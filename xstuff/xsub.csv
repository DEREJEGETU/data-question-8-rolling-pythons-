STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM The Company's Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program (""the Program"") of up to $1.3 billion. Under the Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, shares of its outstanding common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of stock repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations. The Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and the Company has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the Program. The Program has no set expiration date. The Company repurchases its common stock in part to reduce the dilutive effects of stock options and awards, and to improve shareholders' returns. The Company makes open market purchases of its common stock using general corporate funds. Additionally, the Company may enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares. The agreements would require the Company to make up-front payments to the counterparty financial institutions, which would result in either the receipt of stock at the beginning of the term of the agreements followed by a share adjustment at the maturity of the agreements, or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreements, depending upon the price of the stock. During 2017, there were no shares repurchased under the Program. During 2016, the Company repurchased 304,915 shares (2015 - 1,210,932) at an average price of $32.21 (2015 - $41.40) for a total cost of $10 million (2015 - $50 million).

140,RLGY_0001398987-18-000017.html,"For the year ended December 31, 2017, total assets decreased $84 million primarily due to a $96 million net decrease in franchise agreements and other amortizable intangible assets primarily attributable to amortization, a $47 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a $21 million decrease in relocation receivables due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by a $36 million increase in other current and non-current assets primarily due to agent recruiting and retention and higher prepaid expenses, a $22 million increase in property and equipment and a $20 million increase in goodwill from acquisitions. Total liabilities decreased $237 million due to a $159 million decrease in corporate debt primarily due to a $115 million reduction in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and amortization payments on the term loan facilities, a $62 million decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the 2017 Tax Act and a change in our reserve for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by current operating results, a $36 million decrease in other non-current liabilities due to the impact of interest rate swaps and reduced liabilities as a result of cash paid for contingent consideration from acquisitions, and an $11 million decrease in securitization obligations driven by lower relocation volume. These decreases were partially offset by an $15 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a $16 million increase in accounts payable. Total equity increased $153 million primarily due to net income of $431 million, partially offset by a $280 million decrease in additional paid in capital during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in additional paid in capital primarily relates to the Company's repurchase of $280 million of common stock and $49 million of dividend payments, partially offset by stock-based compensation activity of $49 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs have been to service our debt and finance our working capital and capital expenditures, which we have historically satisfied with cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facilities and securitization facilities. In February 2018, the Company increased the borrowing capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility from $1,050 million to $1,400 million and extended the maturities of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan B and Term Loan A. We intend to use future cash flow primarily to acquire stock under our share repurchase program, pay dividends, fund acquisitions, enter into strategic relationships and reduce indebtedness. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $350 million of the Company's common stock which is incremental to the remaining authorization under the share repurchase program authorized in 2017. Repurchases under these programs may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these repurchases will depend on price, market and economic conditions, legal and contractual requirements and other factors. The repurchase programs have no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had repurchased and retired 16.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $475 million under the 2016 and 2017 share repurchase programs at a weighted average market price of $28.77 per share. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $100 million of authorization remains available for repurchase of shares under the 2017 share repurchase program. During the period January 1, 2018 to February 23, 2018, we repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares under the plan at a weighted average market price of $26.82 per share. Giving effect to these repurchases, we had approximately $60 million of remaining capacity authorized under the February 2017 share repurchase program as of February 23, 2018. Beginning in August 2016, we initiated and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share and paid $0.09 per share cash dividends in every subsequent quarter. In 2017, we returned $49 million to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends. The declaration and payment of any future dividend will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions (including restrictive covenants contained in the Company's credit agreement, and the indenture governing the Company's outstanding debt securities), capital requirements and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. In April 2007, the Company established a standby irrevocable letter of credit for the benefit of Avis Budget Group in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The letter of credit was utilized to support the Company's payment obligations with respect to its share of Cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities. In September 2017, the standby irrevocable letter of credit was terminated pursuant to the governing agreement as the aggregate value of the Cendant contingent and other liabilities fell below $30 million with the resolution of a Cendant legacy tax matter in the third quarter of 2017, reducing the capacity and outstanding letters of credit under the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate value of the former parent contingent liabilities was $18 million. We may also from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding notes through tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. We are currently experiencing growth in the residential real estate market; however, if the residential real estate market or the economy as a whole does not continue to improve or weakens, our business, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected, including our ability to access capital and grow our business. Historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been strongest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. A significant portion of the expenses we incur in our real estate brokerage operations are related to marketing activities and commissions and therefore are variable. However, many of our other expenses, such as interest payments, facilities costs and certain personnel-related costs, are fixed and cannot be reduced during a seasonal slowdown. Consequently, our debt balances are generally at their highest levels at or around the end of the first quarter of every year. Our liquidity position has significantly improved but continues to be impacted by our remaining interest expense and would be adversely impacted by stagnation or a downturn of the residential real estate market and a significant increase in LIBOR or ABR. We will continue to evaluate potential refinancing and financing transactions. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives we may pursue as the choice of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our existing financing agreements and the consents we may need to obtain under the relevant documents. There can be no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Cash Flows Year ended December 31, 2017 vs. Year ended December 31, 2016 At December 31, 2017, we had $234 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, a decrease of $47 million compared to the balance of $281 million at December 31, 2016.

We intend to use future cash flow primarily to acquire stock under our share repurchase program, pay dividends, fund acquisitions, enter into strategic relationships and reduce indebtedness. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $350 million of the Company's common stock which is incremental to the remaining authorization under the share repurchase program authorized in 2017. Repurchases under these programs may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these repurchases will depend on price, market and economic conditions, legal and contractual requirements and other factors. The repurchase programs have no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had repurchased and retired 16.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $475 million under the 2016 and 2017 share repurchase programs at a weighted average market price of $28.77 per share. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $100 million of authorization remains available for repurchase of shares under the 2017 share repurchase program. During the period January 1, 2018 to February 23, 2018, we repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares under the plan at a weighted average market price of $26.82 per share. Giving effect to these repurchases, we had approximately $60 million of remaining capacity authorized under the February 2017 share repurchase program as of February 23, 2018. Beginning in August 2016, we initiated and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share and paid $0.09 per share cash dividends in every subsequent quarter. In 2017, we returned $49 million to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends. The declaration and payment of any future dividend will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions (including restrictive covenants contained in the Company's credit agreement, and the indenture governing the Company's outstanding debt securities), capital requirements and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. In April 2007, the Company established a standby irrevocable letter of credit for the benefit of Avis Budget Group in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The letter of credit was utilized to support the Company's payment obligations with respect to its share of Cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities. In September 2017, the standby irrevocable letter of credit was terminated pursuant to the governing agreement as the aggregate value of the Cendant contingent and other liabilities fell below $30 million with the resolution of a Cendant legacy tax matter in the third quarter of 2017, reducing the capacity and outstanding letters of credit under the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate value of the former parent contingent liabilities was $18 million. We may also from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding notes through tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. We are currently experiencing growth in the residential real estate market; however, if the residential real estate market or the economy as a whole does not continue to improve or weakens, our business, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected, including our ability to access capital and grow our business. Historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been strongest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. A significant portion of the expenses we incur in our real estate brokerage operations are related to marketing activities and commissions and therefore are variable. However, many of our other expenses, such as interest payments, facilities costs and certain personnel-related costs, are fixed and cannot be reduced during a seasonal slowdown. Consequently, our debt balances are generally at their highest levels at or around the end of the first quarter of every year. Our liquidity position has significantly improved but continues to be impacted by our remaining interest expense and would be adversely impacted by stagnation or a downturn of the residential real estate market and a significant increase in LIBOR or ABR. We will continue to evaluate potential refinancing and financing transactions. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives we may pursue as the choice of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our existing financing agreements and the consents we may need to obtain under the relevant documents. There can be no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

In September 2017, the standby irrevocable letter of credit was terminated pursuant to the governing agreement as the aggregate value of the Cendant contingent and other liabilities fell below $30 million with the resolution of a Cendant legacy tax matter in the third quarter of 2017, reducing the capacity and outstanding letters of credit under the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate value of the former parent contingent liabilities was $18 million. We may also from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding notes through tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. We are currently experiencing growth in the residential real estate market; however, if the residential real estate market or the economy as a whole does not continue to improve or weakens, our business, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected, including our ability to access capital and grow our business. Historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been strongest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. A significant portion of the expenses we incur in our real estate brokerage operations are related to marketing activities and commissions and therefore are variable. However, many of our other expenses, such as interest payments, facilities costs and certain personnel-related costs, are fixed and cannot be reduced during a seasonal slowdown. Consequently, our debt balances are generally at their highest levels at or around the end of the first quarter of every year. Our liquidity position has significantly improved but continues to be impacted by our remaining interest expense and would be adversely impacted by stagnation or a downturn of the residential real estate market and a significant increase in LIBOR or ABR. We will continue to evaluate potential refinancing and financing transactions. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives we may pursue as the choice of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our existing financing agreements and the consents we may need to obtain under the relevant documents. There can be no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Cash Flows Year ended December 31, 2017 vs. Year ended December 31, 2016 At December 31, 2017, we had $234 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, a decrease of $47 million compared to the balance of $281 million at December 31, 2016.

146,RLGY_0001398987-18-000017.html,"For the year ended December 31, 2017, total assets decreased $84 million primarily due to a $96 million net decrease in franchise agreements and other amortizable intangible assets primarily attributable to amortization, a $47 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a $21 million decrease in relocation receivables due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by a $36 million increase in other current and non-current assets primarily due to agent recruiting and retention and higher prepaid expenses, a $22 million increase in property and equipment and a $20 million increase in goodwill from acquisitions. Total liabilities decreased $237 million due to a $159 million decrease in corporate debt primarily due to a $115 million reduction in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and amortization payments on the term loan facilities, a $62 million decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the 2017 Tax Act and a change in our reserve for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by current operating results, a $36 million decrease in other non-current liabilities due to the impact of interest rate swaps and reduced liabilities as a result of cash paid for contingent consideration from acquisitions, and an $11 million decrease in securitization obligations driven by lower relocation volume. These decreases were partially offset by an $15 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a $16 million increase in accounts payable. Total equity increased $153 million primarily due to net income of $431 million, partially offset by a $280 million decrease in additional paid in capital during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in additional paid in capital primarily relates to the Company's repurchase of $280 million of common stock and $49 million of dividend payments, partially offset by stock-based compensation activity of $49 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs have been to service our debt and finance our working capital and capital expenditures, which we have historically satisfied with cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facilities and securitization facilities. In February 2018, the Company increased the borrowing capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility from $1,050 million to $1,400 million and extended the maturities of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan B and Term Loan A. We intend to use future cash flow primarily to acquire stock under our share repurchase program, pay dividends, fund acquisitions, enter into strategic relationships and reduce indebtedness. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $350 million of the Company's common stock which is incremental to the remaining authorization under the share repurchase program authorized in 2017. Repurchases under these programs may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these repurchases will depend on price, market and economic conditions, legal and contractual requirements and other factors. The repurchase programs have no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had repurchased and retired 16.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $475 million under the 2016 and 2017 share repurchase programs at a weighted average market price of $28.77 per share. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $100 million of authorization remains available for repurchase of shares under the 2017 share repurchase program. During the period January 1, 2018 to February 23, 2018, we repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares under the plan at a weighted average market price of $26.82 per share. Giving effect to these repurchases, we had approximately $60 million of remaining capacity authorized under the February 2017 share repurchase program as of February 23, 2018. Beginning in August 2016, we initiated and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share and paid $0.09 per share cash dividends in every subsequent quarter. In 2017, we returned $49 million to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends. The declaration and payment of any future dividend will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions (including restrictive covenants contained in the Company's credit agreement, and the indenture governing the Company's outstanding debt securities), capital requirements and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.

150,RLGY_0001398987-18-000017.html,"For the year ended December 31, 2017, total assets decreased $84 million primarily due to a $96 million net decrease in franchise agreements and other amortizable intangible assets primarily attributable to amortization, a $47 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a $21 million decrease in relocation receivables due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by a $36 million increase in other current and non-current assets primarily due to agent recruiting and retention and higher prepaid expenses, a $22 million increase in property and equipment and a $20 million increase in goodwill from acquisitions. Total liabilities decreased $237 million due to a $159 million decrease in corporate debt primarily due to a $115 million reduction in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and amortization payments on the term loan facilities, a $62 million decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the 2017 Tax Act and a change in our reserve for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by current operating results, a $36 million decrease in other non-current liabilities due to the impact of interest rate swaps and reduced liabilities as a result of cash paid for contingent consideration from acquisitions, and an $11 million decrease in securitization obligations driven by lower relocation volume. These decreases were partially offset by an $15 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a $16 million increase in accounts payable. Total equity increased $153 million primarily due to net income of $431 million, partially offset by a $280 million decrease in additional paid in capital during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in additional paid in capital primarily relates to the Company's repurchase of $280 million of common stock and $49 million of dividend payments, partially offset by stock-based compensation activity of $49 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs have been to service our debt and finance our working capital and capital expenditures, which we have historically satisfied with cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facilities and securitization facilities. In February 2018, the Company increased the borrowing capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility from $1,050 million to $1,400 million and extended the maturities of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan B and Term Loan A. We intend to use future cash flow primarily to acquire stock under our share repurchase program, pay dividends, fund acquisitions, enter into strategic relationships and reduce indebtedness. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $350 million of the Company's common stock which is incremental to the remaining authorization under the share repurchase program authorized in 2017. Repurchases under these programs may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these repurchases will depend on price, market and economic conditions, legal and contractual requirements and other factors. The repurchase programs have no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had repurchased and retired 16.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $475 million under the 2016 and 2017 share repurchase programs at a weighted average market price of $28.77 per share. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $100 million of authorization remains available for repurchase of shares under the 2017 share repurchase program. During the period January 1, 2018 to February 23, 2018, we repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares under the plan at a weighted average market price of $26.82 per share. Giving effect to these repurchases, we had approximately $60 million of remaining capacity authorized under the February 2017 share repurchase program as of February 23, 2018. Beginning in August 2016, we initiated and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share and paid $0.09 per share cash dividends in every subsequent quarter. In 2017, we returned $49 million to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends. The declaration and payment of any future dividend will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions (including restrictive covenants contained in the Company's credit agreement, and the indenture governing the Company's outstanding debt securities), capital requirements and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. In April 2007, the Company established a standby irrevocable letter of credit for the benefit of Avis Budget Group in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The letter of credit was utilized to support the Company's payment obligations with respect to its share of Cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities. In September 2017, the standby irrevocable letter of credit was terminated pursuant to the governing agreement as the aggregate value of the Cendant contingent and other liabilities fell below $30 million with the resolution of a Cendant legacy tax matter in the third quarter of 2017, reducing the capacity and outstanding letters of credit under the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate value of the former parent contingent liabilities was $18 million. We may also from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding notes through tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. We are currently experiencing growth in the residential real estate market; however, if the residential real estate market or the economy as a whole does not continue to improve or weakens, our business, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected, including our ability to access capital and grow our business. Historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been strongest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. A significant portion of the expenses we incur in our real estate brokerage operations are related to marketing activities and commissions and therefore are variable. However, many of our other expenses, such as interest payments, facilities costs and certain personnel-related costs, are fixed and cannot be reduced during a seasonal slowdown. Consequently, our debt balances are generally at their highest levels at or around the end of the first quarter of every year. Our liquidity position has significantly improved but continues to be impacted by our remaining interest expense and would be adversely impacted by stagnation or a downturn of the residential real estate market and a significant increase in LIBOR or ABR. We will continue to evaluate potential refinancing and financing transactions. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives we may pursue as the choice of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our existing financing agreements and the consents we may need to obtain under the relevant documents.

In February 2018, the Company increased the borrowing capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility from $1,050 million to $1,400 million and extended the maturities of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan B and Term Loan A. We intend to use future cash flow primarily to acquire stock under our share repurchase program, pay dividends, fund acquisitions, enter into strategic relationships and reduce indebtedness. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $350 million of the Company's common stock which is incremental to the remaining authorization under the share repurchase program authorized in 2017. Repurchases under these programs may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these repurchases will depend on price, market and economic conditions, legal and contractual requirements and other factors. The repurchase programs have no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had repurchased and retired 16.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $475 million under the 2016 and 2017 share repurchase programs at a weighted average market price of $28.77 per share. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $100 million of authorization remains available for repurchase of shares under the 2017 share repurchase program. During the period January 1, 2018 to February 23, 2018, we repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares under the plan at a weighted average market price of $26.82 per share. Giving effect to these repurchases, we had approximately $60 million of remaining capacity authorized under the February 2017 share repurchase program as of February 23, 2018. Beginning in August 2016, we initiated and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share and paid $0.09 per share cash dividends in every subsequent quarter. In 2017, we returned $49 million to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends. The declaration and payment of any future dividend will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions (including restrictive covenants contained in the Company's credit agreement, and the indenture governing the Company's outstanding debt securities), capital requirements and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. In April 2007, the Company established a standby irrevocable letter of credit for the benefit of Avis Budget Group in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The letter of credit was utilized to support the Company's payment obligations with respect to its share of Cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities. In September 2017, the standby irrevocable letter of credit was terminated pursuant to the governing agreement as the aggregate value of the Cendant contingent and other liabilities fell below $30 million with the resolution of a Cendant legacy tax matter in the third quarter of 2017, reducing the capacity and outstanding letters of credit under the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate value of the former parent contingent liabilities was $18 million. We may also from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding notes through tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. We are currently experiencing growth in the residential real estate market; however, if the residential real estate market or the economy as a whole does not continue to improve or weakens, our business, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected, including our ability to access capital and grow our business. Historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been strongest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. A significant portion of the expenses we incur in our real estate brokerage operations are related to marketing activities and commissions and therefore are variable. However, many of our other expenses, such as interest payments, facilities costs and certain personnel-related costs, are fixed and cannot be reduced during a seasonal slowdown. Consequently, our debt balances are generally at their highest levels at or around the end of the first quarter of every year. Our liquidity position has significantly improved but continues to be impacted by our remaining interest expense and would be adversely impacted by stagnation or a downturn of the residential real estate market and a significant increase in LIBOR or ABR. We will continue to evaluate potential refinancing and financing transactions. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives we may pursue as the choice of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our existing financing agreements and the consents we may need to obtain under the relevant documents. There can be no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

In September 2017, the standby irrevocable letter of credit was terminated pursuant to the governing agreement as the aggregate value of the Cendant contingent and other liabilities fell below $30 million with the resolution of a Cendant legacy tax matter in the third quarter of 2017, reducing the capacity and outstanding letters of credit under the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate value of the former parent contingent liabilities was $18 million. We may also from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding notes through tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. We are currently experiencing growth in the residential real estate market; however, if the residential real estate market or the economy as a whole does not continue to improve or weakens, our business, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected, including our ability to access capital and grow our business. Historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been strongest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. A significant portion of the expenses we incur in our real estate brokerage operations are related to marketing activities and commissions and therefore are variable. However, many of our other expenses, such as interest payments, facilities costs and certain personnel-related costs, are fixed and cannot be reduced during a seasonal slowdown. Consequently, our debt balances are generally at their highest levels at or around the end of the first quarter of every year. Our liquidity position has significantly improved but continues to be impacted by our remaining interest expense and would be adversely impacted by stagnation or a downturn of the residential real estate market and a significant increase in LIBOR or ABR. We will continue to evaluate potential refinancing and financing transactions. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives we may pursue as the choice of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our existing financing agreements and the consents we may need to obtain under the relevant documents. There can be no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Cash Flows Year ended December 31, 2017 vs. Year ended December 31, 2016 At December 31, 2017, we had $234 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, a decrease of $47 million compared to the balance of $281 million at December 31, 2016.

159,RLGY_0001398987-18-000017.html,"For the year ended December 31, 2017, total assets decreased $84 million primarily due to a $96 million net decrease in franchise agreements and other amortizable intangible assets primarily attributable to amortization, a $47 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a $21 million decrease in relocation receivables due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by a $36 million increase in other current and non-current assets primarily due to agent recruiting and retention and higher prepaid expenses, a $22 million increase in property and equipment and a $20 million increase in goodwill from acquisitions. Total liabilities decreased $237 million due to a $159 million decrease in corporate debt primarily due to a $115 million reduction in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and amortization payments on the term loan facilities, a $62 million decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the 2017 Tax Act and a change in our reserve for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by current operating results, a $36 million decrease in other non-current liabilities due to the impact of interest rate swaps and reduced liabilities as a result of cash paid for contingent consideration from acquisitions, and an $11 million decrease in securitization obligations driven by lower relocation volume. These decreases were partially offset by an $15 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a $16 million increase in accounts payable. Total equity increased $153 million primarily due to net income of $431 million, partially offset by a $280 million decrease in additional paid in capital during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in additional paid in capital primarily relates to the Company's repurchase of $280 million of common stock and $49 million of dividend payments, partially offset by stock-based compensation activity of $49 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs have been to service our debt and finance our working capital and capital expenditures, which we have historically satisfied with cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facilities and securitization facilities. In February 2018, the Company increased the borrowing capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility from $1,050 million to $1,400 million and extended the maturities of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan B and Term Loan A. We intend to use future cash flow primarily to acquire stock under our share repurchase program, pay dividends, fund acquisitions, enter into strategic relationships and reduce indebtedness. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $350 million of the Company's common stock which is incremental to the remaining authorization under the share repurchase program authorized in 2017. Repurchases under these programs may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these repurchases will depend on price, market and economic conditions, legal and contractual requirements and other factors. The repurchase programs have no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had repurchased and retired 16.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $475 million under the 2016 and 2017 share repurchase programs at a weighted average market price of $28.77 per share. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $100 million of authorization remains available for repurchase of shares under the 2017 share repurchase program. During the period January 1, 2018 to February 23, 2018, we repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares under the plan at a weighted average market price of $26.82 per share. Giving effect to these repurchases, we had approximately $60 million of remaining capacity authorized under the February 2017 share repurchase program as of February 23, 2018. Beginning in August 2016, we initiated and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share and paid $0.09 per share cash dividends in every subsequent quarter. In 2017, we returned $49 million to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends. The declaration and payment of any future dividend will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions (including restrictive covenants contained in the Company's credit agreement, and the indenture governing the Company's outstanding debt securities), capital requirements and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.

As part of the Auxilium acquisition, the Company acquired Auxilium's licensed rights covering certain indications of CCH, the active ingredient in XIAFLEX®. As a result, the Company has incurred R&D expense for certain indications of CCH in various stages of development, including a Phase 2b cellulite trial, the results of which were announced in November 2016, and Phase 3 cellulite clinical trials, which began in early 2018.

There can be no assurance that the results of any ongoing or future nonclinical or clinical trials related to these projects will be successful, that additional trials will not be required, that any drug, product or indication under development will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all or that such drug, product or indication could be successfully manufactured in accordance with local current good manufacturing practices or marketed successfully, or that we will have sufficient funds to develop or commercialize any of our products. Manufacturing, supply and other service agreements. We contract with various third party manufacturers, suppliers and service providers to supply our products, or materials used in the manufacturing of our products, and to provide additional services such as packaging, processing, labeling, warehousing, distribution and customer service support. Any interruption to the goods or services provided for by these and similar contracts could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. License and collaboration agreements. We could become obligated to make certain contingent payments pursuant to our license, collaboration and other agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, commercial and/or other milestones. In addition, we may be required to make sales-based royalty payments under certain arrangements if certain products are approved for marketing.

Research and development. Over the past few years, we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new products and expand the value of our existing products beyond what is currently approved in their respective labels. As part of the Auxilium acquisition, the Company acquired Auxilium's licensed rights covering certain indications of CCH, the active ingredient in XIAFLEX®. As a result, the Company has incurred R&D expense for certain indications of CCH in various stages of development, including a Phase 2b cellulite trial, the results of which were announced in November 2016, and Phase 3 cellulite clinical trials, which began in early 2018. We expect to incur R&D expenditures related to the development and advancement of our current generic and branded product pipeline and any additional product candidates we may add via license, acquisition or organically. There can be no assurance that the results of any ongoing or future nonclinical or clinical trials related to these projects will be successful, that additional trials will not be required, that any drug, product or indication under development will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all or that such drug, product or indication could be successfully manufactured in accordance with local current good manufacturing practices or marketed successfully, or that we will have sufficient funds to develop or commercialize any of our products. Manufacturing, supply and other service agreements. We contract with various third party manufacturers, suppliers and service providers to supply our products, or materials used in the manufacturing of our products, and to provide additional services such as packaging, processing, labeling, warehousing, distribution and customer service support. Any interruption to the goods or services provided for by these and similar contracts could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. License and collaboration agreements. We could become obligated to make certain contingent payments pursuant to our license, collaboration and other agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, commercial and/or other milestones. In addition, we may be required to make sales-based royalty payments under certain arrangements if certain products are approved for marketing. Due to the fact that it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved, such contingencies have not been recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 69",0001593034-18-000010,ENDP,2016,"Items contributing to the $6,399.2 million change in cash used in financing activities in 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015 include a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of notes of $2,835.0 million, a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of term loans of $2,800.0 million, a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares of $2,300.0 million, a decrease in proceeds from draw of revolving debt of $145.0 million and an increase in repayments of revolving debt of $305.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in principal payments on notes of $899.9 million, a decrease in principal payments on term loans of $369.8 million, a decrease in amounts for the repurchase of ordinary shares of $250.1 million, a decrease due to the repurchase of convertible notes of $247.8 million, a decrease resulting from payments for deferred financing fees of $124.6 million and a decrease in payments related to the issuance of ordinary shares of $67.0 million",Share Repurchase Authorization Date

During 2017 and 2016, the 2015 Incentive Plan was restated and shareholders approved amendments, primarily to increase the number of ordinary shares available for issuance as long-term incentive compensation under the 2015 Incentive Plan by 3.7 million and 9.5 million shares, respectively. The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares that may be granted for any and all awards under the 2015 Incentive Plan will not exceed 20.5 million shares and at December 31, 2017, we had 10.4 million shares remaining available for grants to employees. The Noble Corporation 1991 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, as amended (the ""1991 Plan""), provides for the granting of options to purchase our shares, with or without stock appreciation rights, and the awarding of restricted shares or units to selected employees. Upon shareholder approval of the 2015 Incentive Plan, as described above, the 1991 Plan was terminated and equity based awards to employees are now made only through the 2015 Incentive Plan. Equity based awards previously granted under the 1991 Plan remain outstanding in accordance with their terms, which include the 1991 Plan. Prior to 2017, we used the Noble Corporation 1992 Nonqualified Stock Options and Share Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the ""1992 Plan""), to issue stock awards to non-employee directors.

Investment cash outflows generally include payments for capital expenditures such as property and equipment. Capital expenditures increased $25.6 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to the construction of new stores and remodeling of existing stores. The fiscal 2017 expenditures of $130.5 million were primarily for (a) the opening of a store in The Mall at Greenhills in Nashville, Tennessee (180,000 square feet), replacing an owned location (180,000 square feet) at that center, (b) the purchase and opening of a store at Temple Mall in Temple, Texas (109,000 square feet), replacing a leased location (91,000 square feet) at that center, (c) the purchase of a store at Layton Hills Mall in Layton, Utah (160,000 square feet), which opened in November 2017 and (d) the remodeling of existing stores.

Our principal source of cash from operating activities is our net income, adjusted for the non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes and noncash compensation under our restricted stock plans. Our $136 million, $339 million and $564 million of cash provided from operating activities in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were affected by cash increases/(decreases) of: (1) $13 million, $123 million and $179 million, respectively, of changes in accounts receivable; (2) $66 million, $18 million and $33 million, respectively, of changes in inventory; and (3) $(76) million, $(115) million and $(42) million, respectively, of changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. In each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, our accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable and accrued liabilities all decreased as a result of lower revenue and activity in general from each year's preceding year. The 2016 and 2015 decreases in inventory were in addition to write-downs totaling $30 million and $26 million, respectively, in our ROV and Subsea Products segments discussed below. In 2017, we used a net of $112 million in investing activities, with $105 million used to fund the capital expenditures described above and $11 million used to purchase Angolan central bank bonds indexed to the U.S. dollar. In 2016, we used a net of $169 million in investing activities, with $143 million used to fund the capital expenditures and business acquisitions described above and $39 million used to purchase Angolan central bank bonds indexed to the U.S. dollar. In 2015, we used a net of $437 million in investing activities, with $424 million used to fund the capital expenditures and business acquisitions described above. In 2017, we used $46 million in financing activities, primarily for the $44 million of cash dividends we paid. In 2016, we used $96 million in financing activities, primarily for the $94 million of cash dividends we paid. In 2015, we used $160 million in financing activities. We borrowed $50 million, repurchased 2.0 million shares for $100 million and paid cash dividends of $106 million. In December 2014, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to 10 million shares of our common stock on a discretionary basis. The program calls for the repurchases to be made in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market and business conditions, levels of available liquidity, cash requirements for other purposes, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on its evaluation of these factors. We expect that any shares repurchased under the new program will be held as treasury stock for future use. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular number of shares. We account for the shares we hold in treasury under the cost method, at average cost. Through December 31, 2015 under the program, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock for $100 million. We did not repurchase any shares in 2017 or 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we retained 12.6 million of the shares we had repurchased through this and a prior program. We expect to hold the shares repurchased for future use. Because of our significant foreign operations, we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks. We generally minimize these risks primarily through matching, to the extent possible, revenue and expense in the various currencies in which we operate.

The program calls for the repurchases to be made in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market and business conditions, levels of available liquidity, cash requirements for other purposes, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on its evaluation of these factors. We expect that any shares repurchased under the new program will be held as treasury stock for future use. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular number of shares. We account for the shares we hold in treasury under the cost method, at average cost. Through December 31, 2015 under the program, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock for $100 million. We did not repurchase any shares in 2017 or 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we retained 12.6 million of the shares we had repurchased through this and a prior program. We expect to hold the shares repurchased for future use. Because of our significant foreign operations, we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks. We generally minimize these risks primarily through matching, to the extent possible, revenue and expense in the various currencies in which we operate.

You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance. It is also possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will fall below our expectations or the expectations of market analysts and investors. If we do not meet these expectations, the price of our common stock may decline significantly. We do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the future. We have paid no cash dividends on our common stock, and we may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future. We intend to retain any earnings to fund our operations. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our credit agreement prohibit the payment of any dividends to the holders of our common stock. There is no guarantee that we will repurchase shares of our common stock under our recently announced stock repurchase program at a level anticipated by our stockholders, which could reduce returns to our stockholders. Decisions to repurchase our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations. In January 2018, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during 2018. The repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and, as of February 22, 2018, we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or otherwise. Our board of director's determination to repurchase shares of our common stock will depend upon market conditions, applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant. Based on an evaluation of these factors, our board of directors may determine not to repurchase shares or to repurchase shares at reduced levels from those anticipated by our stockholders, any or all of which could reduce returns to our stockholders.

We also repurchased approximately 1.6 million additional shares of common stock for a total of 7.5 million shares repurchased during fiscal 2017 for $370.9 million. The repurchased shares included shares purchased as part of our share repurchase program and shares repurchased to satisfy team member tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted shares. As of June 28, 2017, approximately $115.8 million was available under our share repurchase authorizations. Our stock repurchase plan has been and will be used to return capital to shareholders and to minimize the dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards. We evaluate potential share repurchases under our plan based on several factors, including our cash position, share price, operational liquidity, proceeds from divestitures, borrowings, and planned investment and financing needs. Additionally, during fiscal 2017, approximately 225,000 stock options were exercised resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $5.6 million. During fiscal 2017, we paid dividends of $70.8 million to common stock shareholders, compared to $74.1 million in the prior year. Our Board of Directors approved a 6.3% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.32 to $0.34 per share effective with the dividend declared in August 2016. We also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share in May 2017 which was paid subsequent to the end of the year on June 29, 2017 in the amount of $16.6 million.

(u) Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 comprehensive income consists of net income and foreign currency translation adjustments. The foreign currency translation adjustment represents the unrealized impact of translating the financial statements of the Canadian restaurants and the Mexico joint venture with CMR, S.A.B. de C.V. from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars. This amount is not included in net income and would only be realized upon the sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the businesses.

(v) Net Income Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. For the calculation of diluted net income per share, the basic weighted average number of shares is increased by the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted share awards.

Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, we paid BofA $300.0 million in cash and received 5.9 million shares of our common stock. The accelerated share repurchase transaction qualified for equity accounting treatment. Repurchased common stock is reflected as an increase in treasury stock within shareholders' deficit. We also repurchased approximately 1.6 million additional shares of common stock for a total of 7.5 million shares repurchased during fiscal 2017 for $370.9 million. The repurchased shares included shares purchased as part of our share repurchase program and shares repurchased to satisfy team member tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted shares. As of June 28, 2017, approximately $115.8 million was available under our share repurchase authorizations. Our stock repurchase plan has been and will be used to return capital to shareholders and to minimize the dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards. We evaluate potential share repurchases under our plan based on several factors, including our cash position, share price, operational liquidity, proceeds from divestitures, borrowings, and planned investment and financing needs. Additionally, during fiscal 2017, approximately 225,000 stock options were exercised resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $5.6 million. During fiscal 2017, we paid dividends of $70.8 million to common stock shareholders, compared to $74.1 million in the prior year. Our Board of Directors approved a 6.3% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.32 to $0.34 per share effective with the dividend declared in August 2016. We also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share in May 2017 which was paid subsequent to the end of the year on June 29, 2017 in the amount of $16.6 million. The dividend accrual was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of June 28, 2017. (u) Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 comprehensive income consists of net income and foreign currency translation adjustments. The foreign currency translation adjustment represents the unrealized impact of translating the financial statements of the Canadian restaurants and the Mexico joint venture with CMR, S.A.B. de C.V. from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars. This amount is not included in net income and would only be realized upon the sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the businesses. The accumulated other comprehensive loss is presented on the consolidated balance sheets. (v) Net Income Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. For the calculation of diluted net income per share, the basic weighted average number of shares is increased by the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted share awards.
