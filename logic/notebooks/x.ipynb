On February 21, 2014, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing us to acquire up to an aggregate of 20.0 million shares of our common stock. The program allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time for cash in the open market, or in negotiated or block transactions, as market and business conditions warrant and subject to applicable legal requirements. The 20.0 million shares the new program authorizes us to purchase are in addition to the shares we repurchased on or before February 21, 2014 under our previous programs. There is no expiration date for this program, and the program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of our board of directors. All share repurchases since February 21, 2014 have been executed in accordance with this program. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. Accordingly, we did not repurchase any shares during the year ended June 30, 2017. However, we expect to resume the share repurchase program during fiscal year 2018.',\n",
       " '0000318154-18-000004.html': 'Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities We now have global access to our $41.7 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as we no longer reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States. Under the 2017 Tax Act, we owe a repatriation tax on undistributed earnings generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions estimated at $7.3 billion that will be paid over eight years. See Contractual Obligations below. We will also have access to global cash generated from operations in the future. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Capital allocation Consistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we will seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner and will consider several alternatives such as share repurchases, payment of cash dividends, repayment of debt, and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. In addition to deploying our cash balances, we intend to continue to invest in our business and return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements of the Company. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by the stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.79 per share of common stock in 2015, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 27% to $1.00 per share of common stock in 2016, and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.15 per share of common stock in 2017. In December 2017, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.32 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 15% for this period, to be paid in March 2018. We have also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2017, we repurchased $3.1 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $3.2 billion. In 2016 and 2015, we repurchased $3.0 billion and $1.9 billion of our common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, $4.4 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program. In January 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion under our stock repurchase program. Based on our confidence in the long-term outlook for our business, enhanced by the 2017 Tax Act, and consistent with our ongoing objective to return capital to our stockholders, on February 5, 2018, we announced a tender offer to purchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock at a price not greater than $200 per share nor less than $175 per share. The tender offer expires at 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, at the end of Monday, March 5, 2018, unless the offer is extended. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt 54',\n",

The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations, available surplus, the volume of employee stock plan activity, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions, stock price and legal and regulatory requirements.

Summary of Financial Performance Operating Results In Fiscal 2017, we reported net revenues of $6.653 billion, a net loss of $99.3 million, and net loss per diluted share of $1.20, as compared to net revenues of $7.405 billion, net income of $396.4 million, and net income per diluted share of $4.62 in Fiscal 2016. The comparability of our operating results has been affected by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges, as well as the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016 and unfavorable foreign currency effects, all as discussed further below. During Fiscal 2017, net revenues declined 10.2% on a reported basis and 9.9% on a constant currency basis, as defined within \"Transactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\" below. The decline in reported net revenues during Fiscal 2017 reflected lower net revenues from our North America, Europe, and Asia segments, and also reflected the absence of the 53rd week, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $72.2 million during Fiscal 2016. Our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined by 160 basis points to 54.9% during Fiscal 2017, primarily driven by higher non-cash inventory-related charges recorded in connection with our restructuring plans and net unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by increased profitability driven by favorable geographic and channel mix and our quality of sales initiatives, including lower levels of promotional activity within our international businesses. Selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased by 150 basis points to 47.3% during Fiscal 2017, primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net revenues and continued investments in our stores and concession shops, facilities, and infrastructure consistent with our longer-term initiatives, partially offset by our operational discipline and cost savings associated with our restructuring activities. Net income declined by $495.7 million to a loss of $99.3 million in Fiscal 2017 as compared to Fiscal 2016, primarily due to a $676.7 million decrease in operating income, partially offset by a $161.0 million decline in our income tax provision. Net income per diluted share declined by $5.82 to a loss of $1.20 per share in Fiscal 2017 as compared to Fiscal 2016, due to lower net income and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during Fiscal 2017. Our operating results during Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $770.3 million and $211.8 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $592.1 million and $150.1 million, respectively, or $7.10 per diluted share and $1.74 per diluted share, respectively. In addition, our net loss during Fiscal 2017 reflected unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $63.6 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, partially offset by the favorable impact of $15.9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, related to the reversal of an income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax. Net income during Fiscal 2016 reflected the favorable impact of the inclusion of the 53rd week, which increased net income by $8.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Financial Condition and Liquidity We ended Fiscal 2017 in a net cash and investments position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term and non-current investments, less total debt) of $786.2 million, compared to $559.2 million as of the end of Fiscal 2016. The increase in our net cash and investments position was primarily due to our operating cash flows of $952.3 million, partially offset by our use of cash to invest in our business through $284.0 million in capital expenditures, to support Class A common stock repurchases of $215.2 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, and to make cash dividend payments of $164.8 million. We generated $952.3 million of cash from operations during Fiscal 2017, compared to $1.007 billion during Fiscal 2016. The decrease in our operating cash flows was primarily due to a decline in net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital. Our equity declined to $3.300 billion as of April 1, 2017, compared to $3.744 billion as of April 2, 2016, primarily due to our Class A common stock repurchases, dividends declared, and comprehensive loss, partially offset by the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements during Fiscal 2017.',\n",

Our share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date, does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time. We make the determination to repurchase shares based on several factors, including an evaluation of current and future capital needs associated with new restaurant development, current and forecasted cash flows, including dividend payments and growth capital contributions to North Italia and Flower Child, a review of our capital structure and cost of capital, our share price and current market conditions. The timing and number of shares repurchased are also subject to legal constraints and financial covenants under our Facility that limit share repurchases based on a defined ratio. (See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for further discussion of our long-term debt.)

HISTORICAL STOCK PERFORMANC  E  RETURNS  TO  SHAREHOLDER  S We have paid dividends in every year since 1991.  Since going public in 1987, we have maintained a consistent  focus on avoiding, if feasible, the potentially dilutive impact of our  activities on our shareholders. To this end, we have grown our  organization principally with internal cash flow, have supported  the Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries 401(k) and Employee  Stock Ownership Plan with stock purchased in the open market,  and, since creating a stock option program in 2003, have  periodically purchased common stock in the open market to,  among other things, offset the potential impact of our stock option  grants. We have purchased approximately 21.9 million shares  since 2003, and, have granted our employees options to purchase  approximately 13.4 million shares. (Note: These amounts have  been adjusted to reflect the impact of stock splits.) This philosophy  has allowed us to balance internal investment with cash returns to  shareholders. For example, in the last five years we have enjoyed  total sales of $19,281 million, and total pre-tax profit of $3,990  million. During this same time period, we spent approximately  $4,157 million to compensate a group of great employees,  we supported our customers' needs by adding approximately  $613 million in operational working capital (accounts receivable  plus inventory) and by spending approximately $826 million  in net capital expenditures, and we returned $2,074 million to  our shareholders. The latter was principally through dividends  (approximately $1,577 million), with the remainder through  share purchases. A final point worth noting, we also incurred  approximately $1,453 million in income taxes, or approximately  36.4% of the pre-tax profit noted above.\",\n",

The total reduction to net earnings applicable to common shareholders associated with the preferred stock redemption was $2 million due to the accelerated recognition of preferred stock issuance costs. During 2016, we launched a cash tender offer to purchase up to $120 million par amount of certain outstanding preferred stock. Our preferred stock decreased by $118 million as a result of the tender offer, including the purchase of $26 million of our Series I preferred stock, $59 million of our Series J preferred stock, and $33 million of our Series G preferred stock for an aggregate cash payment of $126 million. The total reduction to net earnings applicable to common shareholders associated with the preferred stock redemption was $10 million. The size and terms of the redemptions in 2017 and 2016 were determined in accordance with the Company's 2016 and 2015 capital plans. These preferred stock redemptions benefit the Company by decreasing the amount of preferred dividends paid. Common Stock The Company's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As of December 31, 2017, there were 198 million shares of no par common stock outstanding. The Company continued its common stock repurchase program during 2017 and repurchased 7 million shares of common shares outstanding with a fair value of $320 million at an average price of $45.66 per share. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased an additional 2 million shares of common stock outstanding with a fair value of $115 million at an average price of $53.46 per share, leaving $120 million of repurchase capacity remaining in the 2017 capital plan (which spans the timeframe of July 2017 to June 2018). During 2016 the Company repurchased 3 million shares of common shares outstanding with a fair value of $90 million at an average price of $31.15 per share. 134\",\n",

Following the consummation of the Bard acquisition, the combined company will assume certain potential liabilities relating to Bard, including certain products liability and mass torts claims. Following the consummation of the Bard acquisition, the combined company will have assumed certain potential liabilities relating to Bard, including certain products liability and mass tort claims with respect to the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices and related settlement agreements and judgments. As of September 30, 2017, Bard has reported that there are: (i) approximately 25 federal and 185 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 205 plaintiffs, as well as one putative class action in the United States, are currently pending against Bard's hernia repair implant products, (ii) product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 3,285 plaintiffs are currently pending against Bard in various federal and state jurisdictions with respect to Bard's surgical continence products for women and (iii) product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 1,755 plaintiffs are currently pending against Bard in various federal and state jurisdictions with respect to Bard's vena cava filter products. Bard does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage for certain of these claims and the combined company may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Moreover, in some circumstances adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture, quality or marketing of our combined company's products could result in the FDA suspending or delaying its review of our applications for new product approvals, or imposing post market approval requirements. In addition, reserves established by Bard or the combined company for estimated losses, including with respect to these claims, do not represent an exact calculation of actual liability but instead represent estimates of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, additional reserves may be established from time-to-time, and actual losses relating to the assumed Bard liabilities may be materially higher or lower than the related reserve. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Sales of shares of BD common stock after the completion of the transaction may cause the market price of BD equity securities to fall. We will issue a significant number of shares of our common stock in connection with the Bard acquisition. Many Bard stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock they will receive in the Bard acquisition. Other Bard stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our common stock that they receive in the Bard acquisition. Such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our equity securities and may take place promptly following the Bard acquisition.

Common Stock Offering On January 9, 2018, we completed the offering of 23,364,486 shares of our common stock, no par value, in a registered public offering at $107.00 per share ($105.074 per share after deducting the underwriting discount), pursuant to forward sale agreements with each of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, an affiliate of RBC Capital Markets, LLC and an affiliate of Barclays Capital Inc. (the forward purchasers). The shares offered pursuant to the forward sale agreements were borrowed by the underwriters and therefore are not newly issued shares. The underwriters of the offering fully exercised the option we granted them to purchase an additional 3,504,672 shares of common stock directly from us solely to cover overallotments. After the offering, including the issuance of shares pursuant to the exercise of the overallotment option, the aggregate shares of common stock sold in the offering totaled 26,869,158. We received net proceeds of $368 million (net of underwriting discounts, but before deducting other related expenses) from the sale of shares to cover overallotments. The initial forward sale price under the forward sale agreements is $105.074 per share, which is the public offering price in the common stock offering less the underwriting discount. However, the forward sale price is subject to adjustment pursuant to the forward sale agreements. We did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock sold by the forward sellers to the underwriters. We expect to settle a portion of the forward sale agreements and receive proceeds, subject to certain adjustments, from the sale of those shares of common stock concurrently with, or prior to, the closing of our proposed Merger. We expect to settle the remaining portion of the forward sale agreements after the Merger, if completed, in multiple settlements on or prior to December 15, 2019, which is the final settlement date under the forward sale agreements. At the initial forward sale price of $105.074 per share, we expect that the net proceeds from full physical settlement of the forward sale agreements would be approximately $2.46 billion (after deducting the underwriting discount, but before deducting expenses, and subject to forward price adjustments under the forward sale agreements). In the case of any forward sales that settle after the closing of the Merger, we intend to use the net proceeds to repay indebtedness incurred to finance a portion of the cost of the Merger Consideration and associated transaction costs. If for any reason the Merger has not closed on or prior to December 1, 2018, or the Merger Agreement is terminated at any time prior to such date, then we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, in our sole discretion, voluntary redemption of the mandatory convertible preferred stock discussed below, debt repayment (including repayment of commercial paper), capital expenditures, investments and possibly repurchases of our common stock at the discretion of our board of directors. Although we expect to settle the forward sale agreements entirely by the physical delivery of shares of our common stock in exchange for cash proceeds, we may elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreements. The forward sale agreements are also subject to acceleration by the forward purchasers upon the occurrence of certain events. Before the issuance of shares of our common stock, if any, upon settlement of the forward sale agreements, we expect that the shares issuable upon settlement of the forward sale agreements will be reflected in our diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of our common stock used in calculating diluted EPS is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares of common stock that would be issued upon full physical settlement of the forward sale agreements over the number of shares of common stock that could be purchased by us in the market (based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period) using the proceeds receivable upon full physical settlement (based on the adjusted forward sale price at the end of the reporting period). Consequently, we anticipate there will be no dilutive effect on our EPS except during periods when the average market price of shares of our common stock is above the applicable adjusted forward sale price, which is initially $105.074 per share, subject to increase or decrease based on the overnight bank funding rate, less a spread, and subject to decrease by amounts related to expected dividends on shares of our common stock during the term of the forward sale agreements. However, if we decide to physically settle or net share settle the forward sale agreements, delivery of our shares to the forward purchasers on any such physical settlement or net share settlement of the forward sale agreements would result in dilution to our EPS. Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock Offering On January 9, 2018, in a separate registered public offering, we sold 17,250,000 shares of our 6% mandatory convertible preferred stock, series A (mandatory convertible preferred stock) at $100.00 per share (or $98.20 per share after deducting the underwriting discount), including 2,250,000 shares purchased by the underwriters as a result of fully exercising their option to purchase such shares from us solely to cover overallotments. Each share of mandatory convertible preferred stock has a liquidation value of $100. We intend to use the net proceeds of approximately $1.69 billion (net of underwriting discounts, but before related expenses) from this offering to finance a portion of the Merger Consideration and associated transaction costs.

Seagate Technology plc 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"EIP\"). On October 26, 2011, the shareholders approved the EIP and authorized the issuance of up to a total of 27.0 million ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, plus any shares remaining available for grant under the Seagate Technology plc 2004 Share Compensation Plan (the \"SCP\") as of the effective date of the EIP (which was equal to 11.0 million ordinary shares as of the effective date of the EIP and which will increase by such additional number of shares as will be returned to the share reserve in respect of awards previously granted under the SCP) (together, the \"Share Reserve\"). On October 22, 2014, the shareholders authorized the issuance from the EIP of an additional 25 million ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share. Any shares that are subject to options or share appreciation rights granted under the EIP will be counted against the Share Reserve as one share for every one share granted, and any shares that are subject to restricted share bonus awards, restricted share units, performance share bonus awards or performance share awards (collectively, \"Full-Value Share Awards\") will generally be counted against the Share Reserve as two and five-tenths shares for every one share granted. On October 19, 2016, the shareholders authorized the issuance from the EIP of an additional 7.5 million ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share. As of June 30, 2017, there were approximately 30.8 million ordinary shares available for issuance under the EIP. Dot Hill Systems 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"DHEIP\"). Seagate Technology plc acquired the Dot Hill Systems 2009 Equity Incentive Plan effective October 6, 2015. The Company assumed the remaining authorized but unused share reserve of approximately 2 million shares, based on the conversion ratio, from the DHEIP on the acquisition date. Any shares that are subject to options or share appreciation rights granted under the DHEIP will be counted against the Share Reserve as one share for every one share granted, and any shares that are subject to restricted share bonus awards, restricted share units, performance share bonus awards or performance share awards (collectively, \"Full-Value Share Awards\") will generally be counted against the Share Reserve as one and five-tenths shares for every one share granted. As of June 30, 2017, there were approximately 1 million ordinary shares available for issuance under the DHEIP. Seagate Technology plc Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"ESPP\"). There are 50.0 million ordinary shares authorized to be issued under the ESPP. The ESPP consists of a six-month offering period with a maximum issuance of 1.5 million ordinary shares per offering period. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase ordinary shares through payroll deductions generally at 85% of the fair market value of the ordinary shares. As of June 30, 2017 there were approximately 4.8 million ordinary shares available for issuance under the ESPP. Equity Awards Full-Value Share Awards (e.g. restricted share units, \"RSU\") generally vest over a period of three to four years, with cliff vesting of a portion of each award occurring annually, subject to continuous employment with the Company through the vesting date. Options generally vest as follows: 25% of the options will vest on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and the remaining 75% will vest ratably each month thereafter over the next 36 months. Options granted under the EIP and SCP have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company\\'s ordinary shares on the grant date. Fair market value is defined as the closing price of the Company\\'s ordinary shares on NASDAQ on the grant date. The Company granted awards of performance-based share units (\"PSU\") to its senior executive officers under the SCP and the EIP where vesting is subject to both the continued employment of the participant by the Company and the achievement of certain performance goals established by the Compensation Committee of the Company\\'s Board of Directors, including market-based performance goals. A single PSU represents the right to receive a single ordinary share of the Company. During fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company granted 0.6 million, 0.4 million and 0.3 million PSUs, respectively, where performance is measured based on a three-year average return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") goal and a relative total shareholder return (\"TSR\") goal, which is based on the Company\\'s ordinary shares measured against a benchmark TSR of a peer group over the same three-year period (the \"TSR/ROIC\" awards). These awards vest after the end of the performance period of three years from the grant date. A percentage of these units may vest only if at least the minimum ROIC goal is met regardless of whether the TSR goal is met. The number of share units to vest will range from 0% to 200% of the targeted units. In evaluating the fair value of these units, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation on the grant date, taking the market-based TSR goal into consideration. Compensation expense related to these units is only recorded in a period if it is probable that the ROIC goal will be met, and it is to be recorded at the expected level of achievement.',\n",

As of December 31, 2017, the Company has repurchased $450.0 million, or 2.6 million shares under the program. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company\\'s Board of Directors approved a $5.0 billion share repurchase program which was completed in October 2016.  Additionally, the Company\\'s Board of Directors approved a $10.0 billion accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") program, which was initiated in November 2016. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed the ASR. As a result of the ASR, the Company repurchased 4.2 million and 61.6 million ordinary shares in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Quarterly Dividend During the year ended December 31, 2017 the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share for holders of the Company\\'s ordinary shares in March, June, September and December of 2017. The total amount paid in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $939.8 million.

Our common stock equivalents and common partnership unit equivalents include options to purchase shares of Common Stock, which, if exercised, would result in Aimco's issuance of additional shares and the Aimco Operating Partnership's issuance to Aimco of additional common partnership units equal to the number of shares purchased under the options. These equivalents also include unvested TSR Restricted Stock awards that do not meet the definition of participating securities, which would result in the issuance of additional common shares and common partnership units equal to the number of shares that vest. The effect of these securities was dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and accordingly has been included in the denominator for calculating diluted earnings per share and unit during these periods. Our Time-Based Restricted Stock awards receive dividends similar to shares of Common Stock and common partnership units prior to vesting and our TSR LTIP units receive a percentage of the distributions paid to common partnership units prior to vesting. These dividends and distributions are not forfeited in the event the awards do not vest. Therefore, the unvested restricted shares and units related to these awards are participating securities. The effect of participating securities is included in basic and diluted earnings per share and unit computations using the two-class method of allocating distributed and undistributed earnings when the two-class method is more dilutive than the treasury stock method. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were 0.2 million, 0.2 million and 0.3 million shares of unvested participating restricted securities, respectively. As discussed in Note 7, the Aimco Operating Partnership has various classes of preferred OP Units, which may be redeemed at the holders' option. The Aimco Operating Partnership may redeem these units for cash, or at its option, shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2017, these preferred OP Units were potentially redeemable for approximately 2.3 million shares of Common Stock (based on the period end market price), or cash. The Aimco Operating Partnership has a redemption policy that requires cash settlement of redemption requests for the preferred OP Units, subject to limited exceptions. Accordingly, we have excluded these securities from earnings per share and unit computations for the periods presented above, and we expect to exclude them in future periods.\",\n",

CARGILL TRANSACTION AND OTHER SHARE REPURCHASES Cargill Transaction In May 2011, Cargill divested its interest in us in a split-off (the \"Split-off\") to its stockholders (the \"Exchanging Cargill Stockholders\"), including two trusts that we refer to as the \"MAC Trusts\", and a debt exchange (the \"Debt Exchange\") with certain Cargill debt holders (the \"Exchanging Cargill Debt Holders\"). The agreements relating to what we refer to as the \"Cargill Transaction\" contemplated an orderly distribution of the approximately 64% (285.8 million) of our shares that Cargill formerly held. Following the Split-off and Debt Exchange, the MAC Trusts and Exchanging Cargill Debt Holders sold an aggregate of 157.0 million of these shares in underwritten public secondary offerings or to us, completing the disposition of shares designated to be sold during the 15-month period following the Split-off. All other shares of our stock (approximately 128.8 million shares of our Class A Common Stock (\"Class A Shares\") in the aggregate) received by the Exchanging Cargill Stockholders were subsequently repurchased by us or converted to regular shares of our Common Stock. Following these repurchases and conversions, there are no Class A Shares outstanding and none are authorized under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Other Share Repurchases In February of 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program (the \"2014 Repurchase Program\"), allowing the Company to repurchase Class A Shares or shares of our Common Stock, through direct buybacks or in open market transactions. During 2014 under the 2014 Repurchase Program, 8,193,698 Class A Shares were repurchased under the agreements we entered into with certain Cargill family member trusts and 7,585,085 shares of Common Stock were repurchased on the open market for an aggregate of $727.3 million. During 2015 under this program, 2,560,277 shares of Common Stock were repurchased on the open market for an aggregate of $123.3 million. In May 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program (the \"2015 Repurchase Program\"), allowing Mosaic to repurchase shares of our Common Stock through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase arrangements, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The 2015 Repurchase Program has no set expiration date. In connection with this authorization, the remaining amount of $149.4 million authorized under the 2014 Repurchase Program was terminated. During 2015, we repurchased 1,891,620 shares of Common Stock in the open market under the 2015 Repurchase Program for an aggregate of approximately $75.0 million. In May 2015 and February of 2016, also under the 2015 Repurchase Program, we entered into separate accelerated share repurchase transactions (\"ASRs\") with financial institutions to repurchase shares of our Common Stock for up-front payments of $500 million and $75 million, respectively. For each ASR, the total number of shares delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, were determined at the end of the ASR\\'s purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of our Common Stock during that period, less an agreed discount. The shares received were retired in the period they were delivered, and each up-front payment is accounted for as a reduction to shareholders\\' equity in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in the period the payment was made. Neither ASR was dilutive to our earnings per share calculation from its execution date through its settlement date. The unsettled portion of each ASR during that period met the criteria to be accounted for as a forward contract indexed to our Common Stock and qualified as an equity transaction. F-76',\n",

Grantee shall be entitled to settlement of the PSUs covered by this Agreement at the time that such PSUs vest pursuant to Section 2.1, Section 2.2 or Section 2.4, as applicable.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Grantee\\'s employment terminates for Cause prior to the date on which Shares are delivered, Grantee shall forfeit all of the PSUs. 2.6 Withholding Obligations. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, upon the settlement of any PSUs subject to this Award, the Company shall reduce the number of Shares that would otherwise be issued to the Grantee upon settlement of the Award by a number of Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of such issuance equal to the payment to satisfy the withholding tax obligation of the Company with respect to which the Award is being settled, as determined by the Committee (but in no event greater than the maximum withholding rate applicable to wages of the Grantee). 3. Dividend Rights. The Grantee shall not be entitled to any dividend equivalent rights in respect of the PSUs covered by this Award. 4. No Right to Continued Service. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall be interpreted or construed to confer upon the Grantee any right to continue service an officer or employee of the Company. 5. Adjustments. The provisions of Section 4.2 of the Plan are hereby incorporated by reference, and the PSUs are subject to such provisions. Any determination made by the Committee or the Board pursuant to such provisions shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and shall be final and binding for all purposes of the Plan and this Agreement. 6. Administration Subject to Plan. The Grantee hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions thereof. The terms of this Agreement are governed by the terms of the Plan, and in the case of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall govern. The Committee shall have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding upon the Grantee, the Company and all other interested persons. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Award. 7. Modification of Agreement. Subject to the restrictions contained in the Plan, the Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or alter, suspend, discontinue, cancel or terminate, the Award, prospectively or retroactively; provided that any such waiver, amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, cancellation or termination that would adversely affect the rights of the Grantee or any holder or beneficiary of the Award in more than a de minimis way shall not to that extent be effective without the consent of the Grantee, holder or beneficiary affected. 8. Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the settlement of the PSUs to be made to the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement is intended to qualify as a \"short-term deferral\" pursuant to Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Regulations and this Agreement shall be interpreted consistently therewith. However, under certain circumstances, settlement of the PSUs may not so qualify, and in that case, the Committee shall administer the grant and settlement of such PSUs in strict compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Further, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of a Participant\\'s termination of employment with the Company and all Service Recipients, the Participant is a \"specified employee\" as defined in Section 409A of the Code, and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such termination of service is necessary in order to prevent the imposition of any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Participant) to the minimum extent necessary to satisfy Section 409A of the Code until the date that is six months and one day following the Participant\\'s termination of employment with the Company (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code), if such payment or benefit is payable upon a termination of employment. For purposes of this Agreement, a \"termination of employment\" shall have the same meaning as \"separation from service\" under Section 409A of the Code and Grantee shall be deemed to have remained employed so long as Grantee has not \"separated from service\" with the Company or Successor. Each payment of PSUs constitutes a \"separate payment\" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. 9. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is, or becomes, or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or the Award, or would disqualify the Plan or Award under any laws deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and Award shall remain in full force and effect. 10. Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee without giving effect to the conflicts of law principles thereof, except to the extent that such laws are preempted by Federal law. 11. Successors in Interest. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon any successor to the Company. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Grantee\\'s legal representatives. All obligations imposed upon the Grantee and all rights granted to the Company under this Agreement shall be binding upon the Grantee\\'s heirs, executors, administrators and successors. 12. Resolution of Disputes. Any dispute or disagreement which may arise under, or as a result of, or in any way related to, the interpretation, construction or application of this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee. Any determination made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Grantee and the Company for all purposes. 13. Notices. Any notice to be given under the terms of this Agreement to the Company shall be addressed to the Company in care of its Secretary or its designee, and any notice to be given to the Grantee shall be addressed to him at the address (including an electronic address) then reflected in the Company\\'s books and records. By a notice given pursuant to this Section 13, either party may hereafter designate a different address for notices to be given to him. Any notice, which is required to be given to the Grantee, shall, if the Grantee is then deceased, be given to the Grantee\\'s personal representative if such representative has previously informed the Company of his status and address by written notice under this Section 13. Any notice shall have been deemed duly given when (i) delivered in person, (ii) delivered in an electronic form approved by the Company, (iii) enclosed in a properly sealed envelope or wrapper addressed as aforesaid, deposited (with postage prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Postal Service, or (iv) enclosed in a properly sealed envelope or wrapper addressed as aforesaid, deposited (with fees prepaid) in an office regularly maintained by FedEx, UPS, or comparable non-public mail carrier.

       " '0001564590-18-001617.html': 'Computation of Net Income per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares of common stock primarily consist of employee stock options and restricted stock. Employee stock options, restricted stock and similar equity instruments granted by the Company are treated as potential common stock outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted stock outstanding include restricted stock units and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options which is calculated based on the average share price for each period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and in 2014 and 2015 the amount of benefits that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the award becomes deductible for tax purposes are assumed to be used to repurchase stock. In 2016, upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" the Company removed the excess tax benefit from its assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation method for computing earnings/(loss) per share when a company\\'s capital structure includes either two or more classes of common stock or common stock and participating securities. This method determines earnings/(loss) per share based on dividends declared on common stock and participating securities (i.e., distributed earnings), as well as participation rights of participating securities in any undistributed earnings. The two-class method did not have a significant impact on the calculation or presentation of earnings per share for any of the periods presented. The effect of 4,351,564, 1,650,708 and 1,593,807 shares of common stock equivalents under stock compensation plans were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as such shares would have been anti-dilutive. Comprehensive Income/(Loss) Comprehensive income/(loss) is reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income/(loss) and consists of net income and other gains and losses, net of tax affecting equity that are excluded from net income. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value. Accounts Receivable The Company extends non-interest bearing trade credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business. To minimize credit risk, ongoing credit evaluations of client\\'s financial condition are performed. An estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable or returns are expected. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company sold $202 million and $137 million, respectively, of accounts receivables to third parties and recorded an immaterial loss on the sale to interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $110 million and $71 million, respectively, remained outstanding. The sales were accounted for as true sales, without recourse. We maintain servicing responsibilities of the receivables, for which the related costs are not significant. The proceeds of $202 million and $137 million from the sales were reported as a component of the changes in trade and other receivables, net within operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 75',\n",

On May 26, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split for our Class A and Class B common stock, subject to stockholder approval of an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The amendment, which was approved by stockholders on July 28, 2016, increased the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 85,000,000 to 170,000,000. The amendment did not change the number of authorized Class B common shares, which remains at 400,000,000. The stock split, which was effected as a stock dividend, resulted in the issuance of one new share of Class A common stock for each share of Class A common stock outstanding and one new share of Class B common stock for each share of Class B common stock outstanding. The stock split was also applied to our treasury shares. Thus, the stock split increased the number of Class A shares issued from 85,000,000 to 170,000,000, and increased the number of Class B shares issued from 142,313,000 to 284,626,000. The new shares were distributed on August 18, 2016, to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2016.

CASH REQUIREMENTS - Dividends and Share Repurchase. Returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and the repurchase of outstanding shares has historically been a significant component of our capital allocation plan. We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $187.1 million, $201.7 million and $220.0 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decline from the prior years is due to lower outstanding shares as a result of share repurchase activity. Although we have historically paid dividends and plan to continue to do so, there can be no assurances that circumstances will not change in the future that could affect our ability or decisions to pay dividends. In September 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a $3.5 billion share repurchase program, effective through June 2019. As a part of the repurchase program, in the current year, we purchased $317.0 million of our common stock at an average price of $22.61 per share.

The 25 million depositary shares are equivalent to 2.5 million shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Each depositary share entitled the holder, through the depositary, to a proportional fractional interest in the rights and preferences of a share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation, and voting rights, subject to terms of the deposit agreement. Arconic received $1,213 in net proceeds from the public offering reflecting an underwriting discount. The net proceeds were used, together with the net proceeds of issued debt, to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson. The underwriting discount was recorded as a decrease to Additional capital. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock constitutes a series of Arconic\\'s Class B Serial Preferred Stock, which ranks senior to Arconic\\'s common stock and junior to Arconic\\'s Class A Preferred Stock and existing and future indebtedness.

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every three shares of issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares.

SAG was 15.0% of sales in 2017 compared to 15.9% of sales in 2016. The decrease in SAG was due to lower wages and benefits of $105 million, primarily related to lower incentive compensation and savings from rationalization plans, and lower advertising costs of $49 million. These decreases were partially offset by foreign currency translation of $27 million, primarily in EMEA, and increases due to general inflation. SAG in 2017 included pension expense of $37 million which increased compared to $31 million in 2016, primarily in Americas. Pension expense excluded pension settlement charges in SAG of $11 million ($7 million after-tax and minority) and $1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Rationalizations We recorded net rationalization charges of $135 million ($93 million after-tax and minority) in 2017.

Interest Expense Interest expense was $335 million in 2017, decreasing $37 million from $372 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate to 5.58% in 2017 compared to 6.23% in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by higher average debt balances of $6,001 million in 2017 compared to $5,972 million in 2016.

Other (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense in 2017 was expense of $8 million, increasing $18 million from income of $10 million in 2016. The increase in Other (Income) Expense was primarily due to lower gains on general and product liability (income) expense - discontinued products of $27 million and lower gains on asset sales of $17 million. These increases were partially offset by lower financing fees and financial instruments expense of $28 million. General and product liability (income) expense - discontinued products in 2017 includes a benefit of $5 million ($3 million after-tax and minority) for the recovery of past costs from certain asbestos insurers, as compared to a benefit in 2016 of $24 million ($15 million after-tax and minority) for the recovery of past costs from certain asbestos insurers and a benefit of $10 million related to changes in assumptions for probable insurance recoveries for asbestos claims in future periods.

Net Income Per Share Attributable To Common Stockholders In the calculation of basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders, participating securities are allocated earnings based on actual dividend distributions received plus a proportionate share of undistributed net income attributable to common stockholders, if any, after recognizing distributed earnings. The Company's participating securities do not participate in undistributed net losses because they are not contractually obligated to do so. The computation of diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock that are dilutive were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the earnings of the Company. During periods in which the Company realizes a loss from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders, securities or other contracts to issue common stock would not be dilutive to net loss per share and conversion into common stock is assumed not to occur. Diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated under both the two-class method and the treasury stock method and the more dilutive of the two calculations is presented. The Company's basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed as (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, (ii) less participating share- and unit-based basic earnings (iii) divided by weighted average basic shares outstanding. The Company's diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed as (i) basic net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, (ii) plus diluted adjustments to participating undistributed earnings (iii) divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could materially affect us if we generate taxable income in a future period. For example, on December 22, 2017, the United States enacted H.R.1., known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We currently do not expect H.R.1. to have a material impact on our financial statements as long as we maintain a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets, however we are still in the process of evaluating the new law and do not know the full effect it will have on our business, including our financial statements. We continue to assess the impact of various tax reform proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties in all jurisdictions where we have operations to determine the potential effect on our business and any assumptions we have made about our future taxable income. We cannot predict whether any specific proposals will be enacted, the terms of any such proposals or what effect, if any, such proposals would have on our business if they were to be enacted. We may need to raise additional capital that may not be available. We may need to raise additional capital in the future. Any potential public offering, private placement or debt financing may or may not be similar to the transactions that we entered into in the past. Any debt financing may be on terms that, among other things, include conversion features that could result in dilution to our then-existing security holders and restrict our ability to pay interest and dividends-although we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Additionally, our pledge of specified assets as collateral to secure our obligations under our credit agreement may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. Any equity financings would result in dilution to our then-existing security holders. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs, including clinical trials, incur significant cash exit costs, or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, drugs or drug candidates. Based on many factors, including general economic conditions, additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Issuances of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. As of December 31, 2017, we had 253.3 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2017, we also had outstanding options to purchase 9.8 million shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $91.57 per share. Outstanding vested options are likely to be exercised if the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price, and, in the future, we expect to issue additional options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to directors and employees. In addition, we may issue additional common stock or restricted securities in the future as part of financing activities or business development activities and any such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our then-existing shareholders. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. The issuance of restricted common stock or common stock upon exercise of any outstanding options would be dilutive, and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of common stock or that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices. Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. Our stock repurchases will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that we may deem relevant. We can provide no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices, if at all. We have adopted anti-takeover provisions and are subject to Massachusetts corporate laws that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management or effectuate a business combination involving Vertex. Our corporate charter and by-law provisions and Massachusetts state laws may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of Vertex that might be beneficial to us or our security holders. Although we recently amended our charter to eliminate staggered terms for our Board of Directors, our shareholders will not have the ability to vote for all members of the Board of Directors on an annual basis until 2020. Our by-laws grant the directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of shareholders, and certain provisions of our by-laws may be amended only with an 80% shareholder vote. We may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our Board of Directors may determine.

For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Selling, general and other expenses for manufacturing were $2.8 million, $9.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively. Selling, general and other expenses for our oil and gas production and development businesses were $35.3 million, $109.1 million and $49.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total selling, general and other expenses decreased $91.7 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily reflecting lower costs for our oil and gas production and development businesses and the sale of Conwed in early 2017. Selling, general and other expenses for our oil and gas production and development businesses include impairment charges of $10.1 million, $63.8 million and $20.3 million recorded by JETX in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2017 impairment charge related to the write-off of the remaining Houston County acreage due to the decision made in 2017 to focus on JETX\\'s other higher returning acreage. The 2016 impairment charge primarily related to decisions made by JETX in the third quarter to curtail development of both its southern acreage in the East Eagle Ford and its Houston County acreage. A $55.0 million impairment charge was then recorded for the difference between the carrying value of that acreage and the estimated net realizable value. The 2016 impairment also included the write-down of certain JETX leases that would not benefit its business going forward. The 2015 impairment charge related to the write-down of JETX oil field assets in Houston County to fair value. Depreciation and amortization for the oil and gas production and development businesses were $29.9 million, $30.4 million and $25.1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The significant increase in 2017 and 2016 is due to increased production and additional wells compared to 2015. Income related to associated companies primarily relates to our investments in Garcadia and Linkem. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, income related to Garcadia was $48.2 million, $52.3 million and $53.2 million, respectively, and losses related to Linkem were $32.6 million, $22.9 million and $15.6 million, respectively. Pre-tax income for 2017 includes $208.0 million from manufacturing, including the gain on the sale of Conwed of $178.2 million (including working capital adjustments), $7.9 million of income related to associated companies and $64.8 million related to our investment in HRG, offset partially by pre-tax losses from the oil and gas production and development businesses of $26.0 million. Pre-tax income for 2016 includes $93.2 million related to our investment in HRG, $39.8 million from manufacturing and $26.4 million of income related to associated companies, offset by pre-tax losses for the oil and gas production and development businesses of $90.8 million. Pre-tax losses for 2015 includes losses of $28.0 million related to our investment in HRG and pre-tax losses for the oil and gas production and development businesses of $31.9 million, partially offset by $31.1 million of income from manufacturing and $28.0 million of income related to associated companies. Parent Company Interest Parent company interest totaled $58.9 million, $58.9 million and $87.2 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decline in interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to the repayment of our 8.125% Senior Notes in September 2015. Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted. The Tax Act is one of the most comprehensive changes in the U.S. corporate income tax since 1986 and certain provisions are complex in their application. The Tax Act revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, adopting a territorial income tax system, and imposing a transition tax on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In connection with our initial analysis, we have recorded a discrete tax expense of $450.5 million as a provisional estimate of the impact of the Tax Act during 2017. This provisional estimate primarily consists of a $415.0 million expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset and a $35.5 million expense related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our provision for income taxes was $761.0 million, representing an effective tax rate of about 75%. Our 2017 provision was impacted by a non-cash $450.5 million charge related to the impact of tax reform. This charge increased our effective rate by 44%. Additionally, our 2017 provision was reduced by a $31.9 million benefit resulting from the repatriation of Jefferies earnings from certain of its foreign subsidiaries, along with their associated foreign tax credits. This benefit reduced our effective tax rate for 2017 by approximately 3%. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our provision for income taxes was $122.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of about 39%. Our 2016 provision was increased by a $24.9 million charge related to previously issued stock awards, which increased our effective rate by 8%. The majority of the awards expired unexercised during the first quarter of 2016. The tax deductions associated with the remainder of the awards was less than the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes. 37',\n",

Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $4,781 million of operating cash flow in fiscal 2017 compared to $4,676 million for fiscal 2016. Our fiscal 2017 change in working capital was a cash outflow of $1,141 million compared to an outflow of $1,580 million for fiscal 2016. The change in working capital was primarily due to the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging activities. For fiscal 2017, cash collateral received from counterparties, which is recorded in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, decreased $105 million compared to a decrease of $863 million during fiscal 2016. Refer to the Credit Risk section of Note 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. This decrease in cash collateral was partially offset by a $486 million increase in Accounts Receivable, net driven by higher revenues. Cash used by investing activities was $1,008 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $1,034 million for fiscal 2016, driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments and reverse repurchase agreements, as well as additions of property, plant and equipment. During fiscal 2017, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $118 million compared to an outflow of $57 million in fiscal 2016. This change was partially offset by the maturity of reverse repurchase agreements of $150 million in fiscal 2016 which did not recur in fiscal 2017. Additions of property, plant and equipment were $1,105 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $1,143 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2018, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, new DTC stores, and expanding our digital capabilities. We continue to expect such investments will be approximately 4% of revenues, on average. Cash used by financing activities was $1,942 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $2,671 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease in Cash used by financing activities was primarily driven by increased proceeds from the issuance of debt and commercial paper in fiscal 2017, partially offset by higher dividends and lower excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. In fiscal 2017, we purchased 59.7 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $3,249 million (an average price of $54.43 per share) under the four-year, $12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2017, we had repurchased 79.8 million shares at a cost of approximately $4,437 million (an average price of $55.63 per share) under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Capital Resources On October 21, 2016, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2026 and 2046. The 2026 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion at a 2.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2026. The 2046 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2046. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $1,493 million. Refer to Note 8 - Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on Long-term debt. On August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility. We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2017, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. 37\",\n",

As of June 30, 2017, the Company had been assigned investment-grade ratings with both Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

In addition, the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to rising interest rates, possible downgrades in the Company's credit rating, economic conditions or otherwise.

The total shares exercised were 53 million, 50 million and 44 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Performance Share Unit Awards Performance share units require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are predefined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. The primary performance criterion used is compound annual growth in economic profit over a predefined performance period, which is generally three years. Economic profit is our net operating profit after tax less the cost of the capital used in our business. Beginning in 2015, the Company added net operating revenues as an additional performance criterion. Economic profit and net operating revenues are adjusted for certain items, which are approved and certified by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. In the event the certified results equal the predefined performance criteria, the Company will grant the number of shares equal to the target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance criteria, additional shares up to the maximum award will be granted. In the event the certified results fall below the predefined performance criteria, a reduced number of shares will be granted. If the certified results fall below the threshold award performance level, no shares will be granted. The performance share units granted under this program are then generally subject to a holding period of one year before the shares are released. Performance share units generally do not entitle participants to vote or receive dividends. For most performance share units granted beginning in 2014, the Company includes a relative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. For these awards, the number of shares earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a defined range. The fair value of performance share units that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For the remaining awards that do not include the TSR modifier, the fair value of the performance share units is the quoted market value of the Company's stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the relevant period. In the period it becomes probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the award will be achieved, we recognize expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the shares expected to vest and be released. The remaining fair value of the shares expected to vest and be released is expensed on a straight-line basis over the balance of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance criteria specified in the award, we reverse all of the previously recognized compensation expense in the period such a determination is made. Performance share units are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such as death or disability, in which case former employees or their beneficiaries are provided a cash equivalent payment. As of December 31, 2017, performance share units of 2,088,000, 2,985,000 and 3,139,000 were outstanding for the 2015-2017, 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods, respectively, based on the target award amounts in the performance share unit agreements.\",\n",

As of December 31, 2017, $450 million remained unused under a repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. These share repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Our repurchase of common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Although our Board of Directors commenced declaring quarterly cash dividends in July 2014 as part of our capital deployment program, any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will be able to pay dividends in the future. In addition, any future repurchases of AAG common stock or dividends, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends, could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, any future repurchases of common stock or dividends will diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Further, our repurchase of common stock may fluctuate such that our cash flow may be insufficient to fully cover our share repurchases. Although our share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. 31\",\n",

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had repurchased approximately 11 million shares totaling $444 under the authorizations. To implement these authorizations, we used open market repurchase programs, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 where feasible.

Preferred Equity Interest  The preferred equity interest discussed in Note 12 is not transferable by the trust except through its put and call features, and therefore has been eliminated in consolidation. As originally written, after a period of five years from the contribution or, if earlier, the date upon which the pension plan trust is fully funded as determined under GAAP, AT&T has a right to purchase from the pension plan trust some or all of the preferred equity interest at the greater of the fair market value or minimum liquidation value plus any unpaid cumulative dividends. In addition, AT&T will have the right to purchase the preferred equity interest in the event AT&T\\'s ownership of Mobility is less than 50% or there is a transaction that results in the transfer of 50% or more of the pension plan trust\\'s assets to an entity not under common control with AT&T (collectively, a change of control). In September 2017, AT&T notified the trust and the fiduciary of the preferred equity interest that AT&T committed that it would not exercise its call option of the preferred interest until at least September 9, 2022. The pension plan trust has the right to require AT&T to purchase the preferred equity interest at the greater of their fair market value or minimum liquidation value plus any unpaid cumulative dividends, and in installments, as specified in the contribution agreement upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) at any time if the ratio of debt to total capitalization of Mobility exceeds that of AT&T, (2) the date on which AT&T Inc. is rated below investment grade for two consecutive calendar quarters, (3) upon a change of control if AT&T does not exercise its purchase option, or (4) at any time after a seven-year period ending in September 2020. In the event AT&T elects or is required to purchase the preferred equity interest, AT&T may elect to settle the purchase price in cash or shares of AT&T common stock or a combination thereof. Because the preferred equity interest was not considered outstanding for accounting purposes at year-end, it did not affect the calculation of earnings per share for any of the periods presented.

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the ASR transactions. In connection with the May 2016 issuance of senior notes, AbbVie incurred $52 million of issuance costs. In May 2015, the company issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Approximately $11.5 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and $5.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an ASR. In 2015, the company paid $86 million of costs relating to an $18.0 billion, 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement (the bridge loan) as well as $93 million of costs relating to the May 2015 issuance of senior notes. No amounts were drawn under the bridge loan, which was terminated as a result of the issuance of the senior notes. In September 2015, AbbVie entered into a three-year $2.0 billion term loan credit facility and a 364-day $2.0 billion term loan credit facility. In November 2015, AbbVie drew on these term facilities and used the proceeds to refinance its $4.0 billion of senior notes that matured in 2015. Cash dividend payments totaled $4.1 billion in 2017, $3.7 billion in 2016 and $3.3 billion in 2015. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily due to an increase in the dividend rate. On October 27, 2017, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.64 per share to $0.71 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2018 to stockholders of record as of January 12, 2018. This reflects an increase of approximately 11% over the previous quarterly rate. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.71 per share to $0.96 per share beginning with the dividend payable on May 15, 2018 to stockholders of record as of April 13, 2018. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. In addition to the ASRs, under AbbVie's existing stock repurchase program, the company repurchased approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017, approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in 2016 and approximately 46 million shares for $2.8 billion in 2015 . AbbVie cash-settled $285 million of its December 2016 open market purchases in January 2017 and cash-settled $300 million of its December 2015 open market purchases in January 2016.

The 2016 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously authorized, but unused amounts of $172,386 from the earlier share repurchase program. The 2016 Share Repurchase Program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time. As part of the 2016 Share Repurchase Program, the Company entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. to repurchase $200,000 of the Company's common stock. Under the ASR agreement, the Company paid $200,000 to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and received an initial delivery of 852 shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which were retired and represented 80% of the total shares the Company expected to receive based on the market price at the time of the initial delivery. In May 2016, the ASR settled and an additional 153 shares were delivered to the Company and retired. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement was determined with reference to the average price of the Company's common stock over the term of the agreement. The transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The par value of shares received was recorded as a reduction to common stock with the remainder recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. Upon receipt of the shares, there was an immediate reduction in the weighted average common shares calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share. On March 9, 2017, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2017 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company could repurchase up to $425,000 of the Company's common stock.

In January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. The new stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors is similar to our previous stock repurchase programs. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.10 billion, $1.08 billion, and $625 million, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (\"VWAP\") of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares at an average price per share of $134.20 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price per share of $97.16 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price per share of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 1, 2017, December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 1, 2017, $101.5 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. Subsequent to December 1, 2017, as part of the 2017 stock repurchase authority, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $300 million.

The cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days.

The Plan expires in August 2019. Under the Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to employees, nonemployee directors, consultants and independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common stock during their period of service. The exercise price for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. Options granted under the Plan generally vest over a four-year period. Options granted generally have a term of seven years after the grant date, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events. The Plan prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right after it has been granted or to cancel any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right and immediately replace it with a new stock option or stock appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless approved by stockholders. RSUs granted under the Plan include time-based RSUs that generally vest over a four-year period with 25% vesting on each anniversary of the grant date. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) has the discretion to use different vesting schedules. In addition, performance-based RSUs may be granted under the Plan and are subject to performance criteria and vesting terms specified by the Compensation Committee. Under the Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance is reduced by two shares for every share subject to a full value award, which are specified to be grants that are in the form of performance shares and/or performance unit awards, stock, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The Plan (i) limits the number of shares that may be granted pursuant to awards under the Stock Issuance Program to a participant in any calendar year to 1 million, (ii) limits the initial value of performance units a participant may receive to not more than $5 million and (iii) limits the number of performance shares a participant may receive in a calendar year to 1 million. During fiscal 2017, the shares reserved for issuance under the Plan were increased by approximately 4 million shares of common stock.

We continue to possess significant financial flexibility and access to debt and equity markets as a result of our financial strength, as evidenced by the financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies.  See also ITEM 1, Business - \"Financial Strength Ratings\". We maintain our own economic capital models to monitor and project our overall capital, as well as, the capital at our operating subsidiaries.  A key input to the economic models is projected income and this input is continually compared to actual results, which may require a change in the capital strategy. During 2017, we repurchased 0.2 million shares for $50.0 million in the open market and paid $207.2 million in dividends to adjust our capital position and enhance long term expected returns to our shareholders.  During 2016, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $386.3 million in the open market and paid $195.4 million in dividends.  We may at times enter into a Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan agreement to facilitate the repurchase of shares.  On November 19, 2014, our existing Board authorization to purchase up to 25 million of our shares was amended to authorize the purchase of up to 30 million shares.  As of December 31, 2017, we had repurchased 28.2 million shares under this authorization. Liquidity.  Our liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations.  Positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years.  Collected premiums are generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments.  Our net cash flows from operating activities were $1,162.7 million, $1,383.6 million and $1,108.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Additionally, these cash flows reflected net tax payments of $53.7 million, $42.6 million and $164.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net catastrophe loss payments of $745.0 million, $206.0 million and $167.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If disbursements for claims and benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were to exceed premium inflows, cash flow from reinsurance and insurance operations would be negative.  The effect on cash flow from insurance operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally, cash inflows from investment maturities and dispositions, both short-term investments and longer term maturities are available to supplement other operating cash flows. As the timing of payments for claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, we maintain portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims.  At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we held cash and short-term investments of $1,144.7 million and $913.4 million, respectively.  Our short-term investments are generally readily marketable and can be converted to cash.  Starting in the first quarter of 2016, we implemented a new liquidity sweep facility with investments in short maturity, investment grade, U.S. dollar denominated fixed income securities.  The facility is structured as a limited liability corporation so it is classified on our balance sheet as part of other invested assets.  This facility had $447.9 million of available liquidity at December 31, 2017.  In addition to these cash and short-term investments, at December 31, 2017, we had $1,050.1 million of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less, $7,554.2 million maturing within one to five years and $3,175.7 million maturing after five years.  Our $1,093.1 million of equity securities are comprised primarily of publicly traded securities that can be easily liquidated.  We believe that these fixed maturity and equity securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide ample sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future.  We do not anticipate selling a significant amount of securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but have the ability to do so.  Sales of securities might result in realized capital gains or losses.  At December 31, 2017 we had $66.5 million of net pre-tax unrealized appreciation related to fixed maturity and equity securities, comprised of $249.0 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation and $182.6 million of pre-tax unrealized depreciation.',\n",

On February 12, 2017, the Company\\'s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common shares as market conditions and the Company\\'s liquidity warrant.

The Company expects to incur total one-time charges of approximately $12 million in connection with this workforce reduction and will recognize all of these charges in the first quarter of 2018.  As a result of this workforce reduction, based on currently budgeted amounts, the Company anticipates expenses, exclusive of one-time charges, will be reduced by approximately $10 million for 2018. Inflation: In the last five years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically throughout the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\"). In addition, approximately 5% to 15% of the leases for spaces 10,000 square feet and under expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. The Company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, 46',\n",

Common shares which would be entitled to 10 votes per share must meet one of the following criteria: • common shares for which there has not been a change in beneficial ownership in the past four years; or • common shares received through our various equity plans that have not been sold or otherwise transferred. In the event of a change in beneficial ownership, the new owner of that common share will be entitled to only one vote with respect to that share on all matters until four years pass without a further change in beneficial ownership of the share. Shareholders\\' Rights Plan: Pursuant to a Shareholders\\' Rights Plan adopted by the Board on May 20, 2009, one share purchase right is associated with each of our outstanding common shares. Under the plan, the rights will initially trade together with our common shares and will not be exercisable. In the absence of further action by the directors, the rights generally will become exercisable and allow the holder to acquire our common shares at a discounted price if a person or group acquires 10 percent or more of our outstanding common shares. Rights held by persons who exceed the applicable threshold will be void. Shares held by members of the Smucker family are not subject to the threshold. If exercisable, each right entitles the shareholder to buy one common share at a discounted price. Under certain circumstances, the rights will entitle the holder to buy shares in an acquiring entity at a discounted price. The plan also includes an exchange option. In general, if the rights become exercisable, the directors may, at their option, effect an exchange of part or all of the rights, other than rights that have become void, for common shares. Under this option, we would issue one common share for each right, in each case subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The directors may, at their option, redeem all rights for $0.001 per right, generally at any time prior to the rights becoming exercisable. The rights will expire June 3, 2019, unless earlier redeemed, exchanged, or amended by the directors. In connection with the Big Heart acquisition, we and the rights agent entered into an amendment to the plan providing that neither the approval, execution, delivery, or performance of the merger agreement or the shareholders\\' agreement entered into in connection with the transaction will in any way give rise to any provision of the plan becoming effective, and that none of Blue Holdings I, L.P., the controlling stockholder of BAG, or any of its affiliates will be deemed to be an acquiring person for purposes of the plan. During 2017, we and the rights agent entered into another amendment to the plan to amend the definition of beneficial ownership to provide that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, a person will not be deemed the beneficial owner of, or to beneficially own, the first 10 percent of then-outstanding common shares of the Company that would otherwise be deemed to be beneficially owned by such person, together with all its affiliates and associates, if such person is entitled to file, and files, a statement on Schedule 13G pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b) or Rule 14d-1(c) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Net cash provided by continuing operations was $292.2 million for fiscal year 2017, as compared to net cash provided by continuing operations of $323.8 million for fiscal year 2016, a decrease of $31.6 million. The cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2017 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of $156.9 million, and non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of $105.0 million, deferred taxes expense of $28.9 million, stock based compensation expense of $25.4 million, restructuring and contract termination charges, net, of $12.7 million, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and accretion of discounts of $2.6 million, change in fair value of contingent consideration of $2.2 million, and a loss from disposition of businesses and assets, net of $0.3 million. These amounts were partially offset by a net decrease of $11.1 million in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items, a net increase in working capital of $20.2 million and a non-cash gain related to our postretirement benefit plans, including the mark-to-market adjustment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, of $10.4 million. The change in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items decreased cash provided by operating activities by $11.1 million for fiscal year 2017, primarily related to the timing of payments for pension, taxes, restructuring, royalties and salary and benefits. During fiscal year 2017, we made contributions of $8.4 million, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the United States. Contributing to the net increase in working capital for fiscal year 2017, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in accounts receivable of $36.6 million and an increase in inventory of $17.9 million, which were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $34.3 million. The increase in accounts receivable was a result of higher sales volume late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. The increase in inventory was primarily a result of expanding the amount of inventory held at sales locations within our Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics segments to improve responsiveness to customer requirements and to facilitate the introduction of new products. The increase in accounts payable was primarily a result of the timing of disbursements during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Investing Activities. Net cash used in the investing activities of our continuing operations was $1,522.2 million for fiscal year 2017, as compared to net cash used in the investing activities of our continuing operations of $99.5 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $1,422.6 million. For fiscal year 2017, we used $1,527.2 million of net cash for acquisitions, as compared to $71.9 million used in fiscal year 2016. The increase of $1,455.3 million in net cash for acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of EUROIMMUN and Tulip during fiscal year 2017. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 were $39.1 million, primarily for manufacturing equipment and other capital equipment purchases, as compared to $31.7 million for fiscal year 2016. During fiscal year 2017, we made an equity investment that is accounted for using the cost method of accounting, amounting to $10.8 million. These items were partially offset by a decrease of $17.2 million in restricted cash, primarily related to the release of cash that was placed in escrow related to our acquisition of Tulip Diagnostics Private Limited and our sale of PerkinElmer Labs, Inc. during fiscal year 2016. In addition, we received $36.5 million from the settlement of acquisition-related foreign currency forward contracts, and $1.1 million from disposition of businesses in fiscal year 2017. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by the financing activities of our continuing operations was $782.8 million for fiscal year 2017, as compared to net cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations of $115.0 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of $897.8 million. During fiscal year 2017, borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility totaled $1,061.0 million, which was partially offset by debt payments of $236.0 million. This compares to borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $420.5 million, which was more than offset by debt payments of $902.5 million in fiscal year 2016. During fiscal year 2017, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans was $18.0 million. This compares to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $14.4 million in fiscal year 2016. This cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2017 was partially offset by payments of dividends, settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts, payments for acquisition-related contingent consideration, repurchase of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans, and net payments on other credit facilities. During each of the fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we paid $30.8 million in dividends.

The Company believes, based on current expectations, that cash and other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets, and other available financing resources will be sufficient to fund anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service costs, dividends, share repurchases and other commitments in the foreseeable future. The Company may, from time to time, incur debt to refinance existing indebtedness, purchase equipment under operating leases, repurchase shares or fund equipment additions or new investments. During 2017, the Company invested $559.5 million in capital expenditures. See Capital Expenditures section for further details. During the first half of 2017, KCS concluded its $500.0 million share repurchase program, announced in May 2015 (the \"2015 Program\"). In August 2017, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $800.0 million, which expires on June 30, 2020 (the \"2017 Program\"). Included within the 2017 Program was authorization for an accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") program limited to $200.0 million. The Company entered into an ASR program of $200.0 million in the third quarter of 2017, and settled the program in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company\\'s 2017 repurchases of common stock, which include shares repurchased through the 2015 Program and the 2017 Program, totaled 3,759,678 shares at an average price of $99.90 per share and a total cost of $375.6 million. Remaining share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt. Management\\'s assessment of market conditions, available liquidity and other factors will determine the timing and volume of any future repurchases. Refer to Note 13, Stockholders\\' Equity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional detail on the Company\\'s share repurchase activity. The Company\\'s financing instruments contain restrictive covenants which limit or preclude certain actions; however, the covenants are structured such that the Company expects to have sufficient flexibility to conduct its operations. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of December 31, 2017. For discussion regarding the agreements representing the indebtedness of KCS, see Note 10, Short-Term Borrowings and Note 11, Long-Term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements section in Item 8. During the first half of 2017, the Company\\'s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.33 per share or $69.9 million on its common stock. During the second half of 2017, the Company\\'s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.36 per share or $74.3 million on its common stock. On January 23, 2018, the Company\\'s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per share payable on April 4, 2018, to common stockholders of record as of March 12, 2018. Subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, capital availability and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in the best interest of its stockholders, the Company intends to pay a quarterly dividend on an ongoing basis. On December 31, 2017, total available liquidity (the cash balance plus revolving credit facility availability) was $588.9 million, compared to available liquidity at December 31, 2016 of $789.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in commercial paper and reduction in cash on hand to fund share repurchases made during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the total cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. in foreign subsidiaries was $113.7 million. The Company expects that this cash will be available to fund company operations without incurring significant additional taxes. KCS\\'s operating results and financing alternatives can be impacted by various factors, some of which are outside of its control. For example, if KCS were to experience a reduction in revenues or a substantial increase in operating costs or other liabilities, its earnings could be significantly reduced, increasing the risk of non-compliance with debt covenants. Additionally, the Company is subject to external factors impacting debt and equity capital markets and its ability to obtain financing under reasonable terms is subject to market conditions. Volatility in capital markets and the tightening of market liquidity could impact KCS\\'s access to capital. Further, KCS\\'s cost of debt can be impacted by independent rating agencies which assign debt ratings based on certain factors including competitive position, credit measurements such as interest coverage and leverage ratios, and liquidity.',\n",

Nucor's financial strength allows for a consistent approach to capital allocation throughout the business cycle. Nucor's highest capital allocation priority is to invest for profitable long-term growth through our multi-pronged strategy of optimizing existing operations, acquisitions and greenfield expansions. Our second priority is to provide our stockholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in delivering long-term earnings growth. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and attractively priced growth opportunities are limited. In September 2015, Nucor's board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $900.0 million of shares of its common stock. The Company repurchased $90.3 million of shares of its common stock in 2017 ($5.2 million in 2016 and $66.5 million in 2015). As of December 31, 2017, approximately $738.0 million remained available for share repurchases under the program. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $1.05 billion in 2017, a decrease of 40% compared with cash provided by operating activities of $1.75 billion in 2016. The primary reason for the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was that changes in operating assets and liabilities (exclusive of acquisitions) used cash of $907.0 million in 2017 compared with $32.6 million of cash generated in 2016. The funding of working capital increased over the prior year due mainly to increases in inventories, accounts receivable and federal income taxes receivable, partially offset by increases in net earnings and accounts payable. Inventories and accounts payable increased due to the rise in average scrap and scrap substitutes costs on hand from $258 per ton at year end 2016 to $328 per ton at year end 2017, as well as increased volumes of inventory on hand to support higher operating rates. Accounts receivable increased due to the previously mentioned increase in average sales price per ton and the increase in outside shipments, particularly within the bar mill product group, in the fourth quarter of 2017 over the fourth quarter of 2016. Partially offsetting the decrease in cash generated from changes in operating assets and operating liabilities were increased net earnings in 2017 over prior year levels. A significant item impacting the increase in net earnings in 2017 compared to 2016 was the benefit related to deferred income taxes of $221.2 million in 2017 (expense related to deferred income taxes of $71.5 million in 2016) that was due in large part to the Tax Reform Act enacted in late 2017. Investing Activities Our business is capital intensive; therefore, cash used in investing activities primarily represents capital expenditures for new facilities, the expansion and upgrading of existing facilities and the acquisition of other companies. Cash used in investing activities decreased $106.2 million from 2016 to 2017. The primary driver for the decrease in cash used in investing activities was that cash used for capital expenditures declined $156.3 million in 2017 from the prior year. Capital expenditures in 2016 included Nucor's purchase of 49% of Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc.'s leasehold interest covering approximately 54,000 acres in the South Piceance Basin, NYS's quench and self-tempering expansion and significant spending associated with the $230 million cold mill complex at Nucor Steel Arkansas that is scheduled to start-up in the first half of 2019. Additionally, there was a $600.0 million decrease in cash used to purchase investments, offset by a $450.0 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of investments. These decreases in cash used for investing activities were partially offset by the $69.3 million increase in cash used to fund acquisitions over the prior year. Significant acquisitions in 2017 include the purchases of Republic Conduit and Southland Tube, Inc. in January 2017 and St. Louis Cold Drawn, Inc. in September 2017, while Independence Tube Corporation was purchased in the previous year. In 2016, cash from investing activities benefited from the receipt of $135.0 million from the sale of our 50% equity interest in Hunter Ridge Energy Services LLC. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2017 was $1.24 billion compared with cash used in financing activities of $626.4 million in 2016. The majority of the change was due to the repayment of $600.0 million of 5.75% notes that were due in 2017. Additionally, cash used to repurchase treasury stock increased by $85.1 million in 2017 from the prior year. Partially offsetting the increase in cash used to retire debt and to repurchase shares of our common stock was a net increase in 2017 in short-term debt associated with trade credit arrangements used to finance the business of Nucor Trading S.A. over 2016. Nucor increased its quarterly base dividend, resulting in dividends paid of $485.3 million in 2017 compared with $481.1 million in 2016. Our credit facility includes only one financial covenant, which is a limit of 60% on the ratio of funded debt to total capitalization. In addition, the credit facility contains customary non-financial covenants, including a limit on Nucor's ability to pledge the Company's assets and a limit on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. Our funded debt to total capital ratio was 29% at the end of 2017 and 35% at the end of 2016, and we were in compliance with all other covenants under our credit facility at the end of 2017.\",\n",

As of December 31, 2017, the remaining amount of share repurchases authorized by the Board under the Repurchase Program was approximately $717.5 million. On January 24, 2017, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (the \"ASR Program\") with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (\"Goldman\") to repurchase $2.0 billion of the Company\\'s common stock. On January 27, 2017, the Company made a payment of $2.0 billion to Goldman and Goldman delivered to the Company an initial delivery of approximately 7.3 million shares of the Company\\'s common stock, which represents 80% of the payment amount divided by the closing price of the Company\\'s common stock on January 23, 2017. Settlement was based on the daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company\\'s common stock during the repurchase period, less a discount, and resulted in the Company being required either to deliver shares of common stock or to make a cash payment to Goldman. On December 7, 2017, the Company completed the ASR Program by making a final settlement payment of $274.0 million to Goldman.

Proceeds of approximately $180.0 million from the financing were distributed to the joint venture partners in April 2016. On July 22, 2015, we closed on our transaction with Hudson's Bay Company, or HBC, to which HBC contributed 42 properties in the U.S. and we committed to contribute $100.0 million for improvements to the properties contributed by HBC in exchange for a noncontrolling interest in the newly formed entity, HBS. As of December 31, 2017, we have funded $68.3 million of this commitment. On September 30, 2015, HBC announced it had closed on the acquisition of Galeria Holding, the parent company of Germany's leading department store, Kaufhof. In conjunction with the closing, HBS acquired 41 Kaufhof properties in Germany from HBC. All of these properties have been leased to affiliates of HBC. We contributed an additional $178.5 million to HBS upon closing of the Galeria Holding transaction. Our noncontrolling equity interest in HBS is approximately 11.7% at December 31, 2017.

On April 13, 2015, we announced a joint venture with Sears Holdings, or Sears, whereby Sears contributed 10 of its properties located at our malls to the joint venture in exchange for a 50% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture. Sears or its affiliates leased back each of the 10 properties from the joint venture. Seritage Growth Properties, or Seritage, a public REIT formed by Sears, now holds Sears' original 50% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture. We contributed $114.0 million in cash in exchange for a 50% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture. The joint venture has the right to recapture not less than 50% of the space leased to Sears to be used for purposes of redeveloping and releasing the recaptured space. On November 3, 2017, we acquired additional interests in the real estate assets and/or rights to terminate leases related to twelve Sears stores located at our malls (including five stores previously held in our joint venture with Seritage), in order to redevelop these properties. The total cost of this transaction was $184.6 million which is reflected as investment property. Four of the Sears stores are at properties held in unconsolidated joint ventures, and should our partners participate in the transaction and related redevelopment, the cost of the transaction to us will be reduced by their proportionate share. Our joint venture with Seritage now covers the former Sears properties located at five of our malls.

We liquidated these investments in February 2016 to partially fund the acquisition. Additionally, we paid $49 million for the acquisition of two public safety software solution providers, as well as several debt and equity investments. Sales of Investments and Businesses: We received $183 million of proceeds in 2017, compared to $670 million in 2016, and $230 million in 2015. The $183 million of cash provided by investments in 2017 primarily consisted of the sales of short-term government securities. The $670 million of cash received in 2016 was primarily comprised of: (i) $382 million from the sale of an investment used to finance the acquisition of Airwave, (ii) $242 million from the sales of various debt and equity securities, and (iii) $46 million from the sale of our Penang, Malaysia facility and manufacturing operations.

Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures were $227 million in 2017, compared to $271 million in 2016, and $175 million in 2015. The decrease in capital spending in 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily driven by lower facilities spend and lower expenditures on networks that we build and operate on behalf of our customers, partially offset by an increase in information technology spend. The increase in capital spending in 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily driven by an increase in expenditures on networks that we build and operate on behalf of our customers, information technology spend and facilities expenditures.

In the acquisition of Interexport, we assumed $92 million of debt, including a current portion of $40 million, primarily related to capital leases.

The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.7476, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a published conversion price of $67.81 per share). The exercise price adjusts automatically for dividends. In the event of conversion, the notes may be settled in either cash or stock, at our discretion. We intend to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.

We believe that we will be able to maintain sufficient access to the capital markets. Any future disruptions, uncertainty, volatility in the capital markets, or deterioration in our credit ratings may result in higher funding costs for us and adversely affect our ability to access funds. We may, from time to time, seek to retire certain outstanding debt of ours through open market cash purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Share Repurchase Program: Through a series of actions, the Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate share repurchase amount of up to $14.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock (the \"share repurchase program\"). The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2017, we have used approximately $12.3 billion of the share repurchase authority, including transaction costs, to repurchase shares, leaving approximately $1.7 billion of authority available for future repurchases. 34',\n",

The 2014 Incentive Plan permits grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock, deferred stock units, performance awards and other share-based or share-denominated awards with respect to the Company's common stock.

In addition, the 16.9 million shares authorized by shareholders for issuance under the 2014 Incentive Plan will be increased by any shares subject to awards under the 2004 Incentive Plan that were outstanding as of May 27, 2014 and subsequently expire, are forfeited, canceled, settled in cash or otherwise terminate without the issuance of shares. The Company also has a compensation program for non-employee directors (the Director Compensation Program). Under the Director Compensation Program, non-employee directors' compensation consists of an annual retainer, a deferred stock award, committee chair fees and a lead director fee. Each non-employee director may choose to receive all or a portion of his or her annual retainer in the form of cash or deferred stock units which vest upon grant. The annual deferred stock awards vest in full one day prior to the date of the Company's annual meeting of shareholders occurring in the year following the year of the grant date, subject to continued service.

Income Taxes. Income taxes have been provided for using an asset and liability approach in which deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of events that the Company has already recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. Changes in enacted tax rates or laws may result in adjustments to the recorded tax assets or liabilities in the period that the new tax law is enacted. Earnings per Ordinary Share. Basic earnings per ordinary share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per ordinary share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding related to potentially dilutive securities or instruments, if the impact is dilutive. On August 5, 2016, in conjunction with its acquisition of Meda AB (publ.) (\"Meda\"), the Company issued approximately 26.4 million Mylan N.V. ordinary shares to Meda shareholders. The impact of the issuance of these ordinary shares is included in the calculation of basic earnings per share. The weighted average impact for the year ended December 31, 2016, was approximately 10.8 million ordinary shares. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of the Company\\'s ordinary shares under its repurchase program that was previously approved by the Company\\'s Board of Directors and announced on November 16, 2015 (the \"Share Repurchase Program\"), but was not obligated to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares. During 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 12.4 million ordinary shares at a cost of approximately $500.2 million. No ordinary shares were repurchased in 2016, and in 2015 the Company repurchased approximately 1.3 million ordinary shares at a cost of approximately $67.5 million. In January 2018, the Company repurchased an additional 9.8 million ordinary shares at a cost of approximately $432.0 million and on January 9, 2018, the Share Repurchase Program was completed. On September 15, 2008, concurrent with the sale of $575 million aggregate principal amount of Cash Convertible Notes due 2015 (the \"Cash Convertible Notes\"), Mylan Inc. entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with certain counterparties. In connection with the consummation of the EPD Transaction (as defined below in Note 3 Acquisitions and Other Transactions), the terms of the convertible note hedge were adjusted so that the cash settlement value would be based on Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. The terms of the warrant transactions were also adjusted so that, from and after the consummation of the EPD Transaction, the Company could settle the obligations under the warrant transactions by delivering Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. Pursuant to the warrant transactions, and a subsequent amendment in 2011, there were approximately 43.2 million warrants outstanding, with approximately 41.0 million of those warrants having an exercise price of $30.00. The remaining warrants had an exercise price of $20.00. The warrants met the definition of derivatives under the guidance in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging; however, because these instruments had been determined to be indexed to the Company\\'s own ordinary shares and met the criteria for equity classification under ASC 815-40 Contracts in Entity\\'s Own Equity, the warrants were recorded in shareholders\\' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On April 15, 2016, in connection with the expiration and settlement of the warrants, the Company issued approximately 17.0 million Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. The impact of the issuance of these ordinary shares is included in the calculation of basic earnings per share from the date of issuance. The dilutive impact of the warrants, prior to settlement, is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share based upon the average market value of the Company\\'s ordinary shares during the period as compared to the exercise price. For the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, warrants included in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share were 4.9 million and 20.7 million, respectively. 96',\n",

Restricted stock units and restricted shares issued under the plans provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until service-based restrictions have lapsed and any performance objectives have been attained as established by the Committee. Restricted stock units are rights to receive shares subject to certain service and performance conditions as established by the Committee. Generally, upon termination of employment, restricted stock units and restricted shares which have not vested are forfeited. For the company's executives, the restricted units granted in 2017, 2016 and 2015 generally vest ratably over three years. For the company's directors, the restricted units and shares granted in 2017, 2016 and 2015 vest or vested on the first anniversary of the grant. For directors and certain executives, restricted stock units are subject to a post-vest holding period of three years. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted shares represents the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant discounted for the post-vest holding period, when applicable.

The majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and investments are generated from foreign operations, with $3,326 million held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017, of which $304 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The Company believes it has sufficient levels of cash flow and access to its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest, finance potential acquisitions and continue the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S. These cash requirements are managed by the Company's cash flow from operations, its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, and the use of the Company's revolving credit facility. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months.

A REIT is a domestically controlled qualified investment entity if at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. Shareholders. We currently anticipate that we will be a domestically controlled qualified investment entity and, therefore, that the sale of our stock will not be subject to taxation under FIRPTA. However, because our stock will be publicly traded, we cannot assure you that we will be a domestically controlled qualified investment entity. If we were not a domestically controlled qualified investment entity, a non-U.S. Shareholder\\'s sale of our stock would be subject to tax under FIRPTA as a sale of a United States real property interest unless the stock were \"regularly traded\" on an established securities market (such as the New York Stock Exchange) on which the stock will be listed and the selling shareholder owned no more than 10% of the common stock throughout the applicable testing period. If the gain on the sale of stock were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, the non-U.S. Shareholder would be subject to the same treatment as a U.S. Shareholder with respect to the gain (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals). However, even if our stock is not a United States real property interest, a nonresident alien individual\\'s gains from the sale of stock will be taxable if the nonresident alien individual is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on his or her U.S.-source capital gains. A purchaser of our stock from a non-U.S. Shareholder will not be required to withhold under FIRPTA on the purchase price if the purchased stock is \"regularly traded\" on an established securities market. Otherwise, the purchaser of our stock from a non-U.S. Shareholder may be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price and remit this amount to the IRS. Our common stock currently is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. We believe that we qualify under the regularly traded exception to withholding, but we cannot provide any assurance to that effect. Qualified Shareholders Subject to the exception discussed below, a qualified shareholder who holds our common stock directly or indirectly (through one or more partnerships) will not be subject to FIRPTA on distributions by us or dispositions of our common stock. While a qualified shareholder will not be subject to FIRPTA on distributions by us or dispositions of our common stock, a distribution to a qualified shareholder that otherwise would have been taxable under FIRPTA will be treated as an ordinary dividend, and certain investors of a qualified shareholder (i.e., non-U.S. persons who hold interests in the qualified shareholder (other than interests solely as a creditor), and hold more than 10% of our common stock (whether or not by reason of the investor\\'s ownership in the qualified shareholder)) may be subject to FIRPTA and FIRPTA withholding.

Dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future dividend actions. Expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options on Kimberly-Clark\\'s common stock.

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\"ASU 2016-09\"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2017. ASU 2016-09 requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. Accordingly, the Company recorded a discrete income tax benefit of $151 million during 2017 for vested restricted stock units where the grant date stock price was lower than the vesting date stock price. The new guidance will increase the volatility of income tax expense as a result of fluctuations in the Company\\'s stock price. Upon adoption, the Company elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company elected to present excess tax benefits and deficiencies prospectively in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Entities are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The compensation cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock-based award. The Company measures the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") using the Company\\'s share price on the date of grant. For employee share options and instruments with market conditions, the Company uses pricing models. Stock option awards may have performance, market and/or service conditions. If an equity award is modified after the grant-date, incremental compensation cost is recognized for an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. Awards under the Company\\'s stock-based compensation plans vest over various periods. Compensation cost is recorded by the Company on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, multiple awards. Compensation cost was reduced by the number of awards forfeited prior to vesting. The Company amortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation awards made to retirement-eligible employees over the requisite service period. Upon notification of retirement, the Company accelerates the unamortized portion of the award over the contractually required retirement notification period. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs are expensed when incurred. Direct Fund Expense. Direct fund expense, which is expensed as incurred, primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expense incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of certain index trademarks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. Leases. The Company accounts for its office facilities leases as operating leases, which may include escalation clauses. The Company expenses the lease payments associated with operating leases evenly during the lease term (including rent-free periods) commencing when the Company obtains the right to control the use of the leased property. Foreign Exchange. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are subsequently remeasured into the functional currencies of the Company\\'s subsidiaries at the rates prevailing at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on remeasurement are included in general and administration expense on the consolidated statements of income. Revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders\\' equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized on the consolidated statements of income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred income tax assets based upon expected future earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years, future deductibility of the asset, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors. If management determines that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance will be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in additional income tax expense. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax position. In 2017, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation were recognized as an income tax benefit on the consolidated statements of income and are reflected as operating cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows. For prior year periods, excess tax benefits were recognized as additional paid-in capital and financing cash flows. Earnings per Share (\"EPS\"). Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the treasury stock method. Due to the similarities in terms between BlackRock\\'s nonvoting participating preferred stock and the Company\\'s common stock, the Company considers its nonvoting participating preferred stock to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of EPS calculations. As such, the Company has included the outstanding nonvoting participating preferred stock in the calculation of average basic and diluted shares outstanding. Business Segments. The Company\\'s management directs BlackRock\\'s operations as one business, the asset management business. The Company utilizes a consolidated approach to assess performance and allocate resources.

Cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations, if any. Operating, investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations, if any, are presented separately in our statement of cash flows. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted a new share-based compensation accounting standard that requires the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation to be classified as an operating, rather than as a financing, cash flow. In previous periods, we added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, no adjustment is necessary as this benefit is already included in operating cash flows. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.

The year-over-year increases in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to lower incentive compensation and income tax payments, partially offset by a voluntary contribution of $200.0 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2017. We repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2017 at a total cost of $336.6 million. In 2016, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of $500.2 million. At September 30, 2017 there were no outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable. At September 30, 2016, there were $5.3 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2017. Our decision to repurchase shares in 2018 will depend on business conditions, free cash flow generation, other cash requirements and stock price. On April 6, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized us to expend an additional $1.0 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock.

These obligations are recorded as a liability with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fair value of the costs to remove the leasehold improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation using the Company\\'s incremental borrowing rate. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases were immaterial at the end of 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses related to new warehouses, new regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized. The determination of the Company\\'s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate. Certain of the Company\\'s cumulative foreign undistributed earnings were considered by the Company to be indefinitely reinvested as of September 3, 2017. These earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if the Company changed its position and could result in a U.S. tax liability. Although the Company has historically asserted that certain non-U.S. undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested, it may repatriate such earnings to the extent it can do so without an adverse tax consequence. See Note 8 for additional information. Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs and the \"if converted\" method for the convertible note securities. Stock Repurchase Programs Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information. 53',\n",

The increase is primarily attributable to our cash generated from operations, partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities of $493.2 million, payment of dividends of $344.0 million, payment of term loans of $130.0 million, cash used for a business acquisition of $28.6 million and payment for stock repurchases of $25.0 million.

If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated.

Of the $2.16 billion, the remaining cash of $156.4 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries and branches for which earnings are not indefinitely reinvested.

The 2005 Plan authorizes the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted and restricted stock, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights, cash-based awards and other equity-based awards. Subject to adjustments upon certain corporate transactions or events, awards with respect to up to a maximum of 27,030,000 fungible units may be granted under the 2005 Plan.

Awards granted under the 2005 Plan prior to the approval of the fourth amendment and restatement in June 2016 continue to count against the fungible unit limit based on the ratios that were in effect at the time such awards were granted, which may be different than the current ratios. As a result, depending on the types of awards issued, the 2005 Plan may result in the issuance of more or less than 27,030,000 shares. If a stock option or other award granted under the 2005 Plan expires or terminates, the common stock subject to any portion of the award that expires or terminates without having been exercised or paid, as the case may be, will again become available for the issuance of additional awards. Shares of our common stock distributed under the 2005 Plan may be treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares. Currently, unless the 2005 Plan has been previously terminated by the Company's board of directors, new awards may be granted under the 2005 Plan until June 2, 2026, which is the tenth anniversary of the date that the 2005 Plan was most recently approved by the Company's stockholders.

Options are granted under the plan with an exercise price at the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and, subject to employment, generally expire five or ten years from the date of grant, are not transferable other than on death, and generally vest in one to five years commencing one year from the date of grant. We have also granted Class O LTIP Units, which are a class of LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership structured to provide economics similar to those of stock options. Class O LTIP Units, once vested, may be converted, at the election of the holder, into a number of common units of the Operating Partnership per Class O LTIP Unit determined by the increase in value of a share of the Company's common stock at the time of conversion over a participation threshold, which equals the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock at the time of grant. Class O LTIP Units are entitled to distributions, subject to vesting, equal per unit to 10% of the per unit distributions paid with respect to the common units of the Operating Partnership. The fair value of each stock option or LTIP Unit granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on historical information with the following weighted average assumptions for grants during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\",\n",

As a result, the Company recognized a $17 million deferred tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2017, the Company had not provided deferred income taxes and foreign withholding taxes for $844 million of undistributed earnings by its non-U.S. subsidiaries as such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Quantification of additional taxes that may be payable on distribution is not practicable. 17. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-Based Compensation Plans. The Company has adopted stock-based compensation plans in order to provide incentives to directors, officers, employees and other individuals providing services to or on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company believes that its stock-based compensation awards encourage high levels of performance by individuals who contribute to the success of the Company and enable the Company to attract, retain and reward talented and experienced individuals. This is accomplished by providing eligible individuals with an opportunity to obtain or increase a proprietary interest in the Company and/or by providing eligible individuals with additional incentives to join or remain with the Company. The stock-based compensation plans serve to better align the interests of management and its employees with those of the Company's shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company awarded stock-based compensation under its Amended and Restated 2008 Long Term Performance Plan (2008 LTPP). Awards under the 2008 LTPP may be granted to any officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, non-employee directors, or to any other individual who provides services to or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. To date, awards under the 2008 LTPP have been in the form of L3's restricted stock units, performance units and options to purchase L3's common stock. On May 3, 2016, the stockholders of L3 approved an amendment to the 2008 LTPP to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 6.8 million shares to approximately 26.0 million shares. Each share of L3's common stock issued under a full value award (that is, awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights) granted on or after February 23, 2016 is counted as 4.26 shares for purposes of this share limit. Each share issued under full value awards granted between February 26, 2013 and February 22, 2016 is counted as 3.69 shares for purposes of the share limit. At December 31, 2017, 7.9 million shares of L3's common stock remained available for future awards under the 2008 LTPP.\",\n",

On February 8, 2011, we entered into a Credit Agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") with Bank of America, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and other Lenders. The Credit Agreement provided for a $200 million, five-year revolving line of credit. On April 5, 2013, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the maturity of the revolving credit facility from April 8, 2016 to April 5, 2018, in addition to incorporating a $150 million term loan facility maturing April 5, 2019. On May 31, 2016, the Credit Agreement was further amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $500 million and to extend the maturity of the revolving credit facility from April 5, 2018 to May 31, 2021. The amendment also incorporated a revised schedule of fees and interest rates. We have the right, subject to certain conditions, including approval of additional commitments by qualified lenders, to increase the revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by an additional $200 million until May 31, 2021. The Credit Agreement allows us and certain designated subsidiaries to borrow in United States dollars, European euros, Swedish kronor, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and other agreed upon currencies. Interest rates under the Credit Agreement are determined based on the type of borrowing. Interest associated with borrowings can be based on either the prime lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. or the published Eurocurrency rate (i.e. LIBOR). The borrowings have an applicable margin that ranges from 0.125 percent to 2.125 percent depending on the applicable base rate and our consolidated total leverage ratio. Including the respective spreads, the one-month Eurocurrency-based borrowing rate was 2.944 percent per annum and the prime lending-based borrowing rate was 4.875 percent per annum at December 31, 2017. The Credit Agreement requires us to pay a commitment fee on the amount of unused revolving commitments at a rate, based on our total leverage ratio, which ranges from 0.150 percent to 0.300 percent of unused revolving commitments. At December 31, 2017, the commitment fee on the amount of unused revolving credit was 0.175 percent per annum. The Credit Agreement contains two financial covenants that require the maintenance of a total leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, with which the Company was in compliance at December 31, 2017. The credit facilities available under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. On May 31, 2016, the Company drew down $105 million under the revolving credit facility and repaid the term loan originally issued under the credit agreement dated April 5, 2013. Interest was accrued and paid monthly based on the one-month LIBOR rate. To manage the interest rate risk arising from the variability in monthly interest expense attributable to amounts drawn under the revolver, the Company entered into two amortizing interest rate swaps with an aggregate of $105 million. The interest rate swaps were designated, and effective, as cash flow hedges. 44',\n",

In March 2017, pursuant to the Tender Offers, the Company repurchased approximately $63 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2018, approximately $733 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.6% senior notes due 2019 and approximately $76 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.70% senior notes due 2020 for total consideration, excluding accrued interest, of approximately $897 million. As a result of these debt extinguishments, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $27.8 million during the first quarter of 2017, primarily comprised of prepayment premiums and a non-cash charge due to the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs. In April 2017, the Company redeemed the remaining approximately $187 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2018 for total consideration, excluding accrued interest of approximately $195 million. As a result of this debt extinguishment, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $4.5 million during the second quarter of 2017, primarily comprised of prepayment premiums, partially offset by the write-off of a deferred gain on previously terminated interest rate swaps. The Company maintains a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that matures in January 2022 (the \"Facility\"). Under the Facility, the Company may borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The Facility also provides for the issuance of up to $100 million of letters of credit, so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Facility. At December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding under the Facility and net availability was approximately $1.2 billion. The Company maintains a $950 million receivables purchase agreement that matures in October 2019 (the \"Securitization Facility\") and bears interest at a margin over a variable interest rate. At December 31, 2017, the borrowing rate margin and the unused line fee on the Securitization Facility were 0.80% and 0.40% per annum, respectively. At December 31, 2017, net availability under the Facility was approximately $623 million. The Company was not in default of any of its debt covenants at December 31, 2017. In September 2017, the Company announced that it is reinstating its SRP that the Company voluntarily suspended in the fourth quarter of 2015 in association with the Jarden Acquisition. On November 2, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an extension and expansion to the Company\\'s existing SRP. Under the updated SRP, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to approximately $1.26 billion of its outstanding shares through the end of 2020. The repurchase of additional shares in the future will depend upon many factors, including the Company\\'s financial condition, liquidity and legal requirements. During 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 5 million shares of its common stock under the SRP valued at approximately $152 million. At December 31, 2017, approximately $1.1 billion remains available under the SRP. At December 31, 2017, there were approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company\\'s common stock that had not been issued and $61 million in cash that had not been paid to the former holders of Jarden shares who are exercising their right to judicial appraisal under Delaware law. Absent consent by the Company, these dissenting shareholders are no longer entitled to the merger consideration, but are instead entitled only to the judicially determined fair value of their shares, plus interest accruing from the date of the Jarden Acquisition, payable in cash. However, it is possible that the Company could issue a consent to or reach agreement with one or more of these shareholders resulting in the issuance of Company shares (in lieu of or along with the payment of cash) in settlement of the dissenters\\' claims. In July 2017, approximately 6.6 million shares of the Company\\'s common stock (representing the stock component of the merger consideration) were issued and approximately $162 million (representing the cash component of the merger consideration) was paid to certain former dissenting shareholders in full settlement of their claims. At December 31, 2017, the Company has accrued approximately $171 million of unpaid consideration related to these former shares of Jarden common stock. Risk Management From time to time, the Company enters into derivative transactions to hedge its exposures to interest rate, foreign currency rate and commodity price fluctuations. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Interest Rate Contracts The Company manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix using interest rate swaps. The Company may use fixed and floating rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest. Floating rate swaps would be used, depending on market conditions, to convert the fixed rates of long-term debt into short-term variable rates. Fixed rate swaps would be used to reduce the Company\\'s risk of the possibility of increased interest costs. Interest rate swap contracts are therefore used by the Company to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision. The cash paid and received from the settlement of interest rate swaps is included in interest expense.',\n",

The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes due 2026, the number of shares of our Class A common stock underlying the Convertible Notes due 2026, which initially gives us the option to purchase approximately 46 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price of approximately $65.18 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $635 million. Concurrently with entering into the convertible note hedge transactions, we also entered into warrant transactions with each option counterparty whereby we sold to such option counterparty warrants to purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to the same number of shares of our Class A common stock, which initially gives the option counterparties the option to purchase approximately 46 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price of approximately $86.08 per share. We received $376 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. For us, the economic effect of these transactions is to effectively raise the initial conversion price from approximately $65.18 per share of our Class A common stock to approximately $86.08 per share of our Class A common stock (thus effectively raising the conversion premium on the Convertible Notes due 2026 from approximately 32.5% to approximately 75%).

While the Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the Operating Partnership, certain provisions of the Operating Partnership agreement place limitations on the Company\\'s power to act with respect to the Operating Partnership. Such limitations could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the Company\\'s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect their interests. The partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5% of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, the Company may not, without first obtaining the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners in the Operating Partnership, transfer all or any portion of the Company\\'s general partner interest in the Operating Partnership to another entity. Such limitations on the Company\\'s power to act may result in the Company\\'s being precluded from taking action that the Board of Directors otherwise believes is in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders. The Company\\'s Charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences, rights and other terms of such stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock. The Company may establish one or more classes or series of stock that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control. Such a transaction might involve a premium price for the Company\\'s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock. Also, such a class or series of stock could have dividend, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interests of holders of common stock. The Company\\'s Charter contains provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock, which may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control. For example, subject to receiving an exemption from the Board of Directors, potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6% in value of the stock (other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 9.9%). This may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock. The Maryland General Corporation Law restricts the voting rights of holders of shares deemed to be \"control shares.\" Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, \"control shares\" are those which, when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer, entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges. Although the Bylaws exempt the Company from the control share provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, the Board of Directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the Bylaws at any time in the future. Moreover, any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the Bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future, but also to control shares previously acquired. If the provisions of the Bylaws are amended or eliminated, the control share provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the Company\\'s stockholders.

Payroll tax funds continued to be collected on Wednesday, May 31, 2017, yet the federal semi-weekly tax payment was delayed until Thursday, June 1, 2017 due to the Memorial Day holiday weekend. As such, a higher client fund obligation existed on May 31, 2017 than May 31, 2016. The timing of the Memorial Day holiday in May 2016 prompted many clients to remit their payrolls before the holiday weekend, resulting in lower direct deposit funds as of May 31, 2016. Timing for fiscal 2016 resulted in a net cash outflow position. May 31, 2016 was a Tuesday, a larger cash outflow day due to clearing of Readychex and tax payments. May 31, 2015 was a Sunday and Fridays are typically higher cash collection days. This timing left higher cash on hand at May 31, 2015 compared to May 31, 2016.

The purpose of both programs is to manage common stock dilution. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166.2 million. $59.7 million of the total purchased was under our May 2014 Program and $106.5 million was under our July 2016 Program.

Activity related to equity-based plans: The increase in activity related to stock-based awards for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and the decrease for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was largely driven by changes in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.

On July 19, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend payment of $0.2125 per share, which will be paid on August 31, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 31, 2017. During fiscal 2017, we provided a voluntary lump-sum settlement offer to certain terminated vested participants in our salaried pension plan. During fiscal 2017, $287.5 million was distributed to such participants from pension plan assets in connection with this offer. We made pension contributions totaling $163.0 million for fiscal 2017, including a $150 million voluntary contribution made in the fourth quarter to improve the funded status of our pension plans. On November 9, 2016, we completed the Spinoff of Lamb Weston. In connection with the Spinoff, Lamb Weston issued to us $1.54 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the \"Lamb Weston notes\"). On November 9, 2016, we exchanged the Lamb Weston notes for approximately $250.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.819% senior notes due 2017, $880.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.9% senior notes due 2018, $154.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.1% senior notes due 2018, $86.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.0% senior notes due 2019, and $71.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.95% senior notes due 2020 (collectively, the \"Conagra notes\"), which had been purchased in the open market by certain investment banks prior to the Spinoff. Following the exchange, we cancelled the Conagra notes. We also received a cash payment of $823.5 million from Lamb Weston as consideration for the Spinoff. During fiscal 2017, we repaid the entire principal balance of $550.0 million of our floating rate notes on the maturity date of July 21, 2016. We also repaid the remaining principal balance of $224.8 million of our 5.819% senior notes due 2017 and $248.2 million principal amount of our 7.0% senior notes due 2019, in each case prior to maturity, resulting in a net loss from the early retirement of debt of $32.7 million. We have access to the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, our commercial paper program, and the capital markets. We believe we also have access to additional bank loan facilities, if needed. We have recently signed an agreement to sell our Wesson® oil business. The sale remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. We expect to realize net proceeds from the sale of approximately $285 million. We expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to either retire or refinance senior debt upon maturity, as market conditions warrant, from operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, proceeds from any divestitures and other disposition transactions, access to capital markets, and our revolving credit facility. Cash Flows In fiscal 2017, we used $583.1 million of cash, which was the net result of $1.18 billion generated from operating activities, $189.3 million used in investing activities, $1.57 billion used in financing activities, and a decrease of $0.2 million in cash due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 30',\n",

Incentive Program The 2003 Incentive Program provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and other forms of award. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned. Outstanding awards are subject to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. Options and SARs may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. The maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive Program is 220 million. Awards that are forfeited, expire or are settled in cash, do not count against this maximum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have a specified term. New awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the Board terminates the plan early. At the end of 2017, remaining shares available for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 89 million. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Awards totaling 8,916 thousand, 9,583 thousand, and 9,681 thousand of restricted (nonvested) common stock units were granted in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation expense for these awards is based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service period. Shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold or transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares and units in each award vesting after three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after seven years. Awards granted to a small number of senior executives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years or retirement, whichever occurs later, for the remaining 50 percent of the award.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities: Net cash provided by financing activities in 2017 totaled $872 million, an increase of $1.19 billion or 370% from the $322 million used in financing activities in 2016. Primarily, the increase reflects additional borrowings associated with the Company's purchase of AAG. Cash used in financing activities in 2016 was down 60% from the $806 million used in 2015. For the three years presented, the Company's financing activities included the use of cash for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the Company's common stock. The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $395 million, $387 million and $368 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The 2010 Equity and Long-Term Compensation Plan was approved by Mattel\\'s stockholders in May 2010 (the \"2010 Plan\"). Upon approval of the 2010 Plan, Mattel terminated its 2005 Equity Compensation Plan (the \"2005 Plan\"), except with respect to grants then outstanding under the 2005 Plan. All restricted stock unit (\"RSU\") awards made under the 2005 Plan have vested as of December 31, 2015. Outstanding stock option grants under the 2005 Plan that have not expired or have not been terminated continue to be exercisable under the terms of their respective grant agreements. The terms of the Amended 2010 Plan are substantially similar to the terms of the 2010 Plan and the 2005 Plan. Under the Amended 2010 Plan, Mattel has the ability to grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, dividend equivalent rights, performance awards, and shares of common stock to officers, employees, and other persons providing services to Mattel. Generally, options vest and become exercisable contingent upon the grantees\\' continued employment or service with Mattel. Nonqualified stock options are granted at not less than 100% of the fair market value of Mattel\\'s common stock on the date of grant, expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant, and vest on a schedule determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, generally during a period of 3 years from the date of grant. In the event of a retirement of an employee aged 55 years or older with 5 or more years of service, or the death or disability of an employee, that occurs in each case at least 6 months after the grant date, nonqualified stock options become fully vested. Similar provisions exist for non-employee directors. Time-vesting RSUs granted under the Amended 2010 Plan generally vest over a period of 3 years from the date of grant. In the event of the involuntary termination of an employee aged 55 years or older with 5 or more years of service, or the death or disability of an employee, that occurs at least 6 months after the grant date, RSUs become fully vested. The Amended 2010 Plan also contains provisions regarding grants of equity compensation to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The Amended 2010 Plan expires on March 26, 2025, except as to any grants then outstanding. The number of shares of common stock available for grant under the Amended 2010 Plan is subject to an aggregate limit of the sum of (i) 77 million shares, (ii) the number of shares that remained available for issuance under the 2005 Plan on May 12, 2010, and (iii) any shares subject to awards outstanding under the 2005 Plan that on or after May 12, 2010 are forfeited or otherwise terminate or expire without the issuance of shares to the holder of the award. The Amended 2010 Plan is further subject to detailed share-counting rules. As a result of such share-counting rules, full-value grants such as grants of restricted stock or RSUs count against shares remaining available for grant at a higher rate than grants of stock options and stock appreciation rights. Each stock option or stock appreciation right grant is treated as using one available share for each share actually subject to such grant, whereas each restricted stock or RSU grant is treated as using three available shares for each share actually subject to such full-value grant. At December 31, 2017, there were approximately 9 million shares of common stock available for grant remaining under the Amended 2010 Plan. Mattel recognized total share-based compensation expense related to stock options and RSUs (including Performance RSUs) of $67.1 million, $54.0 million, and $56.7 million during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which is included in other selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2017, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based payments totaled $105.5 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. Stock Options Mattel recognized compensation expense of $14.1 million, $10.5 million, and $15.2 million for stock options during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which is included within other selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. There was no current year income tax benefit related to stock options during 2017 as future tax benefits related to stock options were fully offset by a valuation allowance. Income tax benefits related to stock option activity during 2016 and 2015 totaled $6.8 million and $5.5 million, respectively. The fair value of options granted has been estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life of the options used in this calculation is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and has been determined based on historical exercise experience. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of Mattel\\'s stock for a period approximating the expected life, the expected dividend yield is based on Mattel\\'s most recent actual annual dividend payout, and the risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues approximating the expected life.

The increase raises the annual dividend payout from $190 to approximately $215. On November 1, 2017, the Board authorized a new share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $500.0 in shares of Common Stock (the \"2017 Share Repurchase Program\").  The 2017 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration and replaced the 2016 Share Repurchase Program.  We also continued our evergreen share repurchase program, authorized by the Board on January 29, 2014, under which we may repurchase, from time to time, Common Stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of Common Stock under our incentive plans. In 2017, we purchased approximately 8.2 million shares of Common Stock for $400.0, of which $125.0 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program, $100.0 was purchased under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program, and $175.0 was purchased under the 2016 Share Repurchase Program. As a result of our purchases, there remained $400.0 under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2017. In December of 2017, we entered an accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") contract with a commercial bank to purchase $200 million of the Common Stock.  On January 4, 2018, we paid $200 million to the bank and received a total of 4.1 million shares during the first quarter of 2018. We used cash on hand plus borrowing to fund the initial purchase price.  We anticipate that our cash from operations, together with our current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately $70.0 in 2018, fund our share repurchase programs to the extent implemented by management and pay dividends at the latest approved rate. Cash, together with our current borrowing capacity, may be used for acquisitions that would complement our existing product lines or geographic markets.

Share Repurchase Program and Dividends Share repurchases are made from time to time in accordance with management\\'s capital allocation strategy, subject to market conditions and regulatory requirements. In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program that began in April 2014 and was completed in the second quarter of 2017. In February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program upon completion of the prior share repurchase program. Repurchases under this program began in May 2017 and total approximately $600 million at December 31, 2017. As a result, we have approximately $900 million remaining under this program. We repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of our ordinary shares during 2017. In August 2017, we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from $0.40 to $0.45 per ordinary share. This reflects a 12.5% increase that began with our September 2017 payment and a 55% increase since the beginning of 2016. Acquisitions During 2017, we acquired several businesses, including channel acquisitions, that complement existing products and services. The aggregate purchase price, net of cash acquired, totaled $157.6 million and was funded through cash on hand. Acquisitions within the Climate segment primarily consisted of independent dealers which support the ongoing strategy to expand our distribution network in North America. Other acquisitions within the segment strengthen our product portfolio. Acquisitions within the Industrial segment primarily consisted of a telematics business which builds upon our growing portfolio of connected assets. In addition, other acquisitions within the segment expand sales and service channels across the globe. On January 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Cameron International Corporation\\'s Centrifugal Compression (Engineered Centrifugal Compression) business for approximately $850 million. The acquired business manufactures centrifugal compression equipment and provides aftermarket parts and services for global industrial applications, air separation, gas transmission and process gas. The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt. The results of the Engineered Centrifugal Compression business have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition and reported within our Industrial segment. On March 4, 2015, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of FRIGOBLOCK for approximately €100 million (approximately $113 million). The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt. The acquired business manufactures and designs transport refrigeration units for trucks and trailers, which it sells primarily in Western Europe. The results of the FRIGOBLOCK business have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition and reported within our Climate segment. Sale of Hussmann Equity Investment During 2011, we completed the sale of a controlling interest of our Hussmann refrigerated display case business (Hussmann) to a newly-formed affiliate of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R).  Per the terms of the agreement, CD&R\\'s ownership interest in Hussmann at the acquisition date was 60% with the remaining 40% being retained by us. As a result, we accounted for our interest in Hussmann using the equity method of accounting. On December 21, 2015, we announced we would sell our remaining equity interest in Hussmann as part of a transaction in which Panasonic Corporation would acquire 100 percent of Hussmann\\'s outstanding shares. The transaction was completed on April 1, 2016. We received net proceeds of $422.5 million for our interest and recognized a gain of $397.8 million on the sale. IRS Exam Results In July 2015, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to resolve disputes related to withholding and income taxes for years 2002 through 2011 (the IRS Agreement). The IRS had previously disagreed with our tax treatment of intercompany debt and distributions and asserted we owed income and withholding tax relating to the 2002-2006 period totaling $774 million, not including interest and penalties. We also provided a substantial amount of information to the IRS in connection with its audit of the 2007-2011 tax periods. We expected the IRS to propose similar adjustments to these periods, although it was not known how the IRS would apply its position to the different facts presented in these years or whether the IRS would take a similar position to intercompany debt instruments not outstanding in prior years. 23',\n",

STOCK INCENTIVE AND STOCK OPTION PLANS In May of 2017 the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the shareholder approved stock incentive plan (the Plan) to increase the number of available shares. The revised Plan allows for the granting of up to 8.5 million total shares of equity awards to executives, employees and non-employee directors. Awards available for grant under the Plan include, but are not limited to, stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and other stock awards. Shares issued under the Plan may be newly issued shares or reissued treasury shares. Stock options are generally granted with a strike price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and a life of 10 years. Stock options granted have a three-year vesting period. The strike price may be higher than the fair value of the stock on the date of the grant, but cannot be lower. Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period beginning on the grant date. The compensation expense is based on the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Options granted to employees eligible for retirement under our retirement plan are fully expensed at the grant date. Stock options are also awarded through the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan (KESIP) which allows certain employees, other than officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an installment basis up to an established credit limit. For every even block of 100 KESIP shares purchased by the employee 50 stock options are granted. The options granted through the KESIP program are considered awards under the Plan and are vested immediately. Compensation expense for stock options granted through the KESIP program is recorded based on the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Performance shares are granted as target awards and are earned based on our return on equity (ROE) performance. A payout factor has been established ranging from 0 to 200 percent of the target award based on our actual ROE performance. Shares have a three-year performance period. The fair value of the award is equal to the average market price, adjusted for the present value of dividends over the vesting period, of our stock on the grant date. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the period beginning on the grant date until the shares become unrestricted and is based on the amount of the award that is expected to be earned under the plan formula, adjusted each reporting period based on current information. Restricted common stock is awarded from time to time at no cost to certain employees. Participants are entitled to cash dividends and voting rights. Restrictions limit the sale or transfer of the shares during a defined period. Generally, one-third of the shares become vested and free from restrictions after two years and one-third of the shares issued become vested and free from restrictions each year thereafter on the anniversary of the grant date, provided the participant remains an employee. The fair value of the award is equal to the average market price of our stock on the grant date. Compensation expense is determined at the grant date and is recognized over the restriction period on a straight-line basis. Employee compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to our share-based plans for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was approximately $39 million, $31 million and $22 million, respectively. In addition, non-employee director share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was approximately $2 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively. Shares granted to non-employee directors vest immediately and have no restrictions or performance conditions. The excess tax benefit associated with our employee share-based plans for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was $2 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to nonvested awards for our employee share-based plans was approximately $41 million at December 31, 2017, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of less than two years. 105',\n",

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares and Class C capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. Furthermore, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation. In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Class C Adjustment Payment was allocated to the numerator for calculating net income per share of Class C capital stock from net income available to all stockholders and the remaining undistributed earnings were allocated on a pro rata basis to Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock based on the number of shares used in the per share computation for each class of stock. The weighted-average share impact of the Class C Adjustment Payment is included in the denominator of both basic and diluted net income per share computations for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts): 75',\n",

Shelf Registration Statement - On November 15, 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of our common stock. The availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand, market conditions and other factors. We make no assurances regarding when, or if, we will issue any shares under this registration statement. On April 2, 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, registering 8.0 million shares of our common stock that we may offer and issue from time to time in connection with future acquisitions of other businesses, assets or securities. At December 31, 2017, 0.1 million shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement. On November 15, 2016, we filed another shelf registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, registering an additional 10.0 million shares of our common stock, none of which had been issued as of December 31, 2017. Common Stock Repurchases - We have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock at cost of $17.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock at cost of $101.0 million. We did not repurchase any shares in 2015. Under the provisions of the repurchase plan, we are authorized to repurchase approximately 7.5 million additional shares at December 31, 2017. The plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous, in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. We are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares, and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion. Funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, short-term or long-term borrowings under our Credit Agreement or other sources. Common Stock Issuances - Another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were $60.4 million in 2017, $45.6 million in 2016 and $54.2 million in 2015. On May 16, 2017, our stockholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the LTIP), which replaced our previous stockholder-approved 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan. All of our officers, employees and non-employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the LTIP. Awards which may be granted under the LTIP include non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock units, any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria. Stock options with respect to 16.2 million shares (less any shares of restricted stock issued under the LTIP - 4.0 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose as of December 31, 2017) were available for grant under the LTIP at December 31, 2017. Our employee stock purchase plan allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95% of its fair market value. Proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future. Outlook - We believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short- and long-term cash flow needs.',\n",

In the fourth quarter of 2016, Apache purchased and canceled $181 million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes through open market repurchases for $182 million in cash, including accrued interest and $0.5 million of premium. These repurchases resulted in a $1 million net loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in \"Financing costs, net\" in our statement of consolidated operations. The net loss includes an acceleration of related discount and deferred financing costs. In January 2017, Apache purchased and canceled an additional $69 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes for $71 million in cash, including accrued interest and $1 million of premium, which completed the open market repurchase program. These repurchases resulted in a $1 million net loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in \"Financing costs, net\" in the Company\\'s consolidated statement of operations. The net loss includes an acceleration of related discount and deferred financing costs. In August 2017, the Company assumed the obligations of Apache Finance Canada Corporation (AFCC) in respect of $300 million 7.75% notes due in 2029 which AFCC issued and the Company guaranteed pursuant to the governing indenture. The assumption was permitted by the indenture and effected pursuant to a supplemental indenture thereto. As a result of the assumption, the Company is the obligor under the notes and indenture, and AFCC is released from its obligations thereunder. The $300 million 7.75% notes historically have been included in the Company\\'s long-term debt; accordingly, the assumption did not change the Company\\'s long-term debt or total debt. Available Credit Facilities In June 2015, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility which matures in June 2020, subject to Apache\\'s two, one-year extension options. The facility provides for aggregate commitments of $3.5 billion (including a $750 million letter of credit subfacility), with rights to increase commitments up to an aggregate $4.5 billion. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Apache\\'s available borrowing capacity under this facility supports its commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under this credit facility, leaving aggregate available borrowing capacity at $3.5 billion. At the Company\\'s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2015 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. The Company also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon the Company\\'s senior long-term debt rating. At December 31, 2017, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, the LIBOR margin was 1.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent. The financial covenants of the 2015 credit facility require the Company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015. At December 31, 2017, the Company\\'s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 31 percent. The 2015 facility\\'s negative covenants restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the United States and Canada, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics\\' liens. The Company also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 5 percent of the Company\\'s consolidated assets, or approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017. Negative covenants also restrict Apache\\'s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold. In February 2016, Apache entered into a letter of credit facility providing £900 million in commitments, and rights to increase commitments to £1.075 billion. The facility matures in February 2020 and is available for letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and any other foreign currency consented to by an issuing bank. The facility also is available for loans in pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, and Canadian dollars to cash collateralize letters of credit or obligations to provide letters of credit, in each case, to the extent letters of credit are unavailable under the facility.

Borrowings bear interest per annum at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin. A facility fee at a per annum rate on aggregate commitments also is payable. Letter of credit commissions, the interest margin, and the facility fee vary depending on Apache\\'s senior unsecured long-term debt rating.

In addition, the Company has invested considerable resources to teach and train associates to utilize tools and techniques that accelerate success in these key areas, as well as to create a culture that demands excellence through continuous improvement. Additionally, the Company promotes a \"pay-for-performance\" culture that rewards various levels of year over year improvement, while closely monitoring appropriate risk-taking. The expected outcome of these activities will be to better position the Company to deliver on its full potential, to provide a platform for future growth opportunities, and to allow the Company to achieve its long-term financial goals. See the Outlook section below for additional information. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company\\'s principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows generated primarily from its business operations, cash on hand, and various sources of borrowings. The ability of the Company to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to fund its operations and capital expenditures, pay dividends, meet its obligations as they become due, and maintain compliance with covenants contained in its financing agreements. Based on its cash on hand, availability under existing financing arrangements, and current projections of cash flow from operations, the Company believes that it will be able to meet its liquidity needs over the next 12 months. Short-term needs are expected to include funding its operations as currently planned, making anticipated capital investments, funding potential acquisitions, paying quarterly stockholder dividends as currently anticipated, paying principal and interest on borrowings as currently scheduled, making required contributions into its employee benefit plans, and potentially repurchasing shares of its outstanding common stock as authorized by the Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). During the current year, the Company purchased two million shares of the Company\\'s common stock, which completed the share repurchases previously authorized by the Board. In June 2017, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional two million shares of the Company\\'s outstanding common stock in the future. The Company expects to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis. No shares have been purchased under this plan as of August 31, 2017. During fiscal 2018, the Company currently expects to invest approximately 2.0% of net sales in capital expenditures primarily for equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and new and enhanced information technology capabilities. Additionally, management believes that the Company\\'s cash flow from operations and sources of funding, including, but not limited to, borrowing capacity, will sufficiently support the long-term liquidity needs of the Company. Cash Flow The Company uses available cash and cash flow from operations, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options, to fund operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, repurchase Company stock, and pay dividends. The Company\\'s cash position at August 31, 2017 was $311.1 million, a decrease of $102.1 million from August 31, 2016. During the year ended August 31, 2017, the Company generated net cash from operating activities of $316.2 million and received proceeds from the sale of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate of $13.2 million. Cash generated from operating activities, as well as cash on-hand, was used during the current year primarily to repurchase shares of the Company\\'s outstanding common stock of $357.9 million, to fund capital expenditures of $67.3 million, and to pay dividends to stockholders of $22.7 million. Foreign currency related items had a favorable effect on cash flows of $1.9 million during the current year.

In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. Debt and Derivatives In December 2017, we increased the borrowing capacity of our commercial paper programs from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion. All of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were under these commercial paper programs. In connection with these programs, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion. In December 2017, we replaced our five-year $2.0 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in December 2019, with a new, substantially identical five-year $2.0 billion credit facility that expires in December 2022. In addition, we added a separate 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility that expires in December 2018. At January 28, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities, and none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. At January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, there were $1.6 billion and $710 million, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs. We also issue senior notes from time to time. We use derivative financial instruments in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates on certain long-term debt. See Note 4 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and derivative agreements. Leases We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. See Note 3 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our capital and operating leases. Share Repurchases In fiscal 2017, we repurchased 49.5 million shares of our common stock for $8.0 billion through ASR agreements and open market transactions. In February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. In December 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the February 2017 authorization.

Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased 6.9 million shares of our common stock for $839 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017; 24.8 million shares for $2.3 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016; and 13.8 million shares for $1.2 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015. At July 31, 2017, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.5 billion for stock repurchases. Future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Our treasury shares are repurchased at the market price on the trade date; accordingly, all amounts paid to reacquire these shares have been recorded as treasury stock on our balance sheets. Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount. In the past we have satisfied option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting under our employee equity incentive plans by reissuing treasury shares, and we may do so again in the future. During the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we began issuing new shares of common stock to satisfy option exercises and RSU vesting under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. We have not yet determined the ultimate disposition of the shares that we have repurchased in the past, and consequently we continue to hold them as treasury shares.\",\n",

In June 2013, the Company commenced a hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it executed a series of issuer capped call transactions (\"Capped Calls\"). The Capped Calls gave the Company the right to buy shares of its common stock subject to the Warrants at specified prices at maturity. This hedge transaction was completed in January 2014 and included the purchase of Capped Calls on a total of 27.2 million shares of the Company\\'s common stock for a total premium of $368.7 million. Subsequently, the Company paid a premium of $100.0 million in January 2015 to increase the cap price on certain of the Capped Calls subject to the 2016 Warrants. The Capped Calls allowed the Company to acquire shares of its common stock at strike prices of $51.50 and $52.50 and had expiration dates ranging from February 2016 through October 2017. The Capped Calls permitted net share settlement, which was limited by caps on the market price of the Company\\'s common stock. The Company accounted for the Capped Calls as equity contracts, and therefore, the above premium was recorded as a reduction to paid-in capital. In May 2014, the Company\\'s board of directors authorized a special program that allowed the Company to purchase up to $650 million of its outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions, as an opportunity to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants and supplement the Company\\'s previously executed warrants hedging strategy. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the Company purchased 3.4 million shares of its common stock for a total of $252.0 million under this program, which included $18.0 million of purchases that cash settled in October 2014. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the Company purchased 4.3 million shares (1.6 million under the Call Options for a total of $151.2 million, as defined below) of its common stock for a total of $398.0 million under this program, which excluded $18.0 million of purchases that cash settled in October 2014, to complete its authorization under this program. In March 2015, the Company further supplemented its hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it executed a series of issuer call options (\"Call Options\"). The Call Options gave the Company the right to buy shares of its common stock subject to the Warrants at specified prices between April 2015 and October 2015. In total, the Company purchased Call Options on six million shares of its common stock for a total premium of $80.0 million. The Company accounted for the Call Options as equity contracts, and therefore, the above premium was recorded as a reduction to paid-in capital. In April 2015, the Company\\'s board of directors authorized a special share repurchase program allowing it to repurchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of its common stock, subject to market conditions, to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the Warrants as part of its warrants hedging strategy. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the Company purchased 10.0 million shares (2.9 million under the Call Options for a total of $276.3 million) of its common stock for a total of $1.0 billion to complete its authorization under this program. In September 2015, the Company\\'s board of directors authorized a special share repurchase program allowing the Company to repurchase up to $2.4 billion in shares of its common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the Company purchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock for a total of $124.1 million under this program. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased 26.3 million shares of its common stock for a total of $1,535.1 million under this program. The Company had $740.9 million of availability remaining under this special share repurchase program as of September 30, 2016. However, this availability will not be utilized as the earnings per share dilution effect of the Warrants was fully mitigated by the Company concurrent with the August 2016 exercise of the 2017 Warrants (see below). In March 2016, the 2016 Warrants were exercised by WBA for $1,168.9 million in cash. The shares issued for the 2016 Warrants were from the Company\\'s treasury stock on a first-in, first-out basis, and were originally purchased for $866.0 million. The Company recognized a reissuance gain in Additional Paid-in Capital of $302.9 million. In August 2016, the Company and WBA amended the 2017 Warrants so that they became exercisable in whole or in part during the six-month period beginning in August 2016 at an exercise price of $52.50. In August 2016, the 2017 Warrants were exercised by WBA for $1,191.6 million in cash.

We expect to use these amounts to fund our international operations and international expansion activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock. Net cash provided by operating activities was $763.9 million for fiscal 2017, which was an increase of $298.0 million compared to fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the $229.5 million payment of taxes due on the gain on the sale of Shred-it. Net cash used in investing activities was $2,310.3 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $128.4 million of net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2016. Capital expenditures were $273.3 million and $275.4 million for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.

Net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds related to the sale of Shred-it and Storage of $28.3 million and $616.2 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 also included net proceeds of $37.3 million from purchases and redemptions of marketable securities and investments compared to net purchases of $60.0 million in fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,578.5 million for fiscal 2017, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $866.7 million for fiscal 2016. The increase from fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016 is primarily due to the net issuance of $1,732.7 million of debt and the decrease in stock buybacks. To finance the G&K acquisition, Cintas issued various forms of debt, totaling $2,091.2 million, net. In addition, on June 1, 2016, Cintas paid the $250.0 million five-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. On August 4, 2015, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. During fiscal 2017, we purchased 0.1 million shares at an average price of $94.09 per share for a total purchase price of $3.7 million. This completed the August 4, 2015 program through which Cintas purchased a total of 5.7 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $87.89 for a total purchase price of $500.0 million. During fiscal 2016, we purchased $759.2 million of common stock under previously authorized share buyback programs.

In certain cases, the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. As a result, the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance. We cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves. In July 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program. Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $1 billion, excluding fees, commissions and other ancillary expenses. In October 2016, we paused repurchases under the program as we evaluated a number of potential acquisition opportunities. As discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we completed the acquisitions of NES in April 2017 and Neff in October 2017. In October 2017, our Board authorized the resumption of the $1 billion share repurchase program, and we intend to complete the program in 2018. The Company had completed $655 million of repurchases under the program as of December 31, 2017. Although the Board of Directors has authorized the share repurchase program, the share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. In addition, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions.

PPG contributed $54 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and an additional $25 million in January 2018. In 2017, the Company made contributions aggregating $33 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2018, mandatory contributions to PPG's non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. In 2017, unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half was completely offset by favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of the year. Based on mid-January 2018 exchange rates, the Company expects year-over-year favorable foreign currency translation to increase 2018 sales by $250 million to $300 million and 2018 income before income taxes by $25 million to $30 million. We expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more prevalent during the first half of 2018, due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends. The foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2018 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from the guidance provided above. The Company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction costs. With the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company's 2018 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23.0% and 24.0%. This range represents the Company's best estimate, including the new legislation, however, our estimate is subject to revision as the Company completes its assessment of the new law and as additional regulations and interpretations are issued. Other factors may affect the expected 2018 effective tax rate positively or negatively throughout the year, including changes to various statutory tax rates and regulations around the world. Over the past four years, the Company used $3.4 billion of cash to repurchase about 33 million shares of PPG stock, including over $800 million in 2017. The Company ended the year with approximately $3.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorizations.

These payments are also recorded as deferred revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Share-Based Compensation Expense The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, employee stock purchases related to the Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"Employee Stock Purchase Plan\"), deferred stock units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units based on their fair values. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings includes compensation expense for the share-based payment awards based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the guidance on share-based compensation. The Company values VMS\\'s stock options granted and the option component of the shares of VMS common stock purchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Share-based compensation expense for restricted common stock, restricted stock units and deferred stock units is measured at the stock\\'s fair value on the date of grant and is amortized over each award\\'s respective service period. The Company values performance units, which contain a market condition, using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant with assumptions that includes the historical volatility of shares of VMS common stock, as well as the shares of common stock of peer companies. In addition, the Company estimates the probability that certain performance conditions that affect the vesting of performance units will be achieved, and recognizes expense only for those awards expected to vest. Both the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model require the input of certain assumptions and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of share-based payment awards. Share-based compensation expense recognized is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest. The Company attributes the value of share-based compensation to expense using the straight-line method. The Company considers only the direct tax impacts of share-based compensation awards when calculating the amount of tax windfalls or shortfalls. Earnings per share Basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to Varian by the weighted average number of shares of VMS common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to Varian by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common shares under the treasury stock method. The Company excludes potentially dilutive common shares from the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding if the per share value, either the exercise price of the awards or the sum of (a) the exercise price of the awards and (b) the amount of the compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized and (c) the amount of tax benefit or shortfall that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the award becomes deductible, is greater than the average market price of the shares, because the inclusion of the shares underlying these stock awards would be antidilutive to earnings per share.

The Committee may, in its discretion, amend the definition of Eligible Transferees to conform to the coverage rules of Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933 or any comparable Form from time to time in effect. Following transfer, any such Options shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer. The events of Termination of Employment of Sections 7(e), 7(f) and 7(g) hereof shall continue to be applied with respect to the original Participant, following which the Options shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for the periods specified, in Sections 7(e), 7(f) and 7(g).

Terms and Conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights (a) Grants. The Committee also may grant (i) a Stock Appreciation Right independent of an Option or (ii) a Stock Appreciation Right in connection with an Option, or a portion thereof. A Stock Appreciation Right granted pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence (A) may be granted at the time the related Option is granted or at any time prior to the exercise or cancellation of the related Option, (B) shall cover the same Shares covered by an Option (or such lesser number of Shares as the Committee may determine) and (C) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as such Option except for such additional limitations as are contemplated by this Section 8 (or such additional limitations as may be included in an Award agreement). (b) Terms. The exercise price per Share of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be an amount determined by the Committee but in no event shall such amount be less than the greater of (i) the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in conjunction with an Option, or a portion thereof, the Option Price of the related Option and (ii) an amount permitted by applicable laws, rules, by-laws or policies of regulatory authorities or stock exchanges. Each Stock Appreciation Right granted independent of an Option shall entitle a Participant to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right in whole or in part and, upon such exercise, to receive from the Company an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of one Share over (B) the exercise price per Share, times (ii) the number of Shares covered by the portion of the Stock Appreciation Right so exercised. Each Stock Appreciation Right granted in conjunction with an Option, or a portion thereof, shall entitle a Participant to surrender to the Company the unexercised Option, or any portion thereof, and to receive from the Company in exchange therefor an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of one Share over (B) the Option Price per Share, times (ii) the number of Shares covered by the Option, or portion thereof, which is surrendered. The date a notice of exercise is received by the Company shall be the exercise date. Payment shall be made in Shares or in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, valued at such Fair Market Value, all as shall be determined by the Committee. Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised from time to time upon actual receipt by the Company of written notice of exercise stating the number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is being exercised. No fractional Shares will be issued in payment for Stock Appreciation Rights, but instead cash will be paid for a fraction or, if the Committee should so determine, the number of Shares will be rounded downward to the next whole Share. No Participant shall have any rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares subject to a Stock Appreciation Right until the occurrence of the exercise date, the issuance of Shares pursuant to such exercise and, if applicable, the satisfaction of any other conditions imposed by the Committee pursuant to the Plan. (c) Exercisability. Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee, but in no event shall a Stock Appreciation Right be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted. (d) Limitations. The Committee may impose, in its discretion, such conditions upon the exercisability or transferability of Stock Appreciation Rights as it may deem fit. (e) Limited Stock Appreciation Rights. The Committee may grant LSARs that are exercisable upon the occurrence of specified contingent events. Such LSARs may provide for a different method of determining appreciation, may specify that payment will be made only in cash and may provide that any related Awards are not exercisable while such LSARs are exercisable. Unless the context otherwise requires, whenever the term \"Stock Appreciation Right\" is used in the Plan, such term shall include LSARs. 9. Other Stock-Based Awards (a) Generally. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may grant Awards of unrestricted Shares, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and other Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on the Fair Market Value of, Shares (collectively, \"Other Stock-Based Awards\"). Such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be in such form, and dependent on such conditions, as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, the right to receive one or more Shares (or the equivalent cash value of such Shares) upon the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event and/or the attainment of performance',\n",
       " '0000927066-18-000030.html': \"Long-term incentive compensation Long-term incentive program (LTIP) compensation includes both stock-based awards (principally stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance stock units) as well as long-term performance-based cash awards. Long-term incentive compensation expense, which was primarily general and administrative in nature, was attributed among our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business, corporate administrative support, and the ancillary services and strategic initiatives. Our stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash. The value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight-line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures. During 2017, we granted approximately 1,692,154 stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SSARs) with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $24.5 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 4.2 years and approximately 528,968 stock units with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $34.8 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 3.4 years. We also granted 15,000 cash-settled stock-based awards with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $0.3 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, long-term incentive compensation expense of $62.0 million and $65.0 million decreased by approximately $3.0 million and $59.0 million as compared to 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense was primarily due to cumulative revaluation of liability-based awards for reductions in estimated ultimate payouts, as well as the final vesting of a prior broad grant that is no longer contributing expense. As of December 31, 2017, there was $98.0 million in total estimated but unrecognized long-term incentive compensation expense for LTIP awards outstanding, including $61.2 million relating to stock-based awards under our equity compensation plans. We expect to recognize the performance-based cash component of these LTIP costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.1 years and the stock-based component of these LTIP costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we received $13.5 million, $28.4 million and $45.7 million, respectively, in actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. Since we issue stock-settled stock appreciation rights rather than stock options, we did not receive cash proceeds from stock option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Stock repurchases We repurchased a total of 12,966,672 shares for $811 million, or an average price of $62.54 during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we have repurchased 1,237,800 additional shares of our common stock for $93 million, or an average price of $74.96 per share, through February 22, 2018. On October 10, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization in the amount of $1.3 billion. This share repurchase authorization was in addition to the $247 million remaining at that time under our Board of Directors' prior share repurchase authorization announced in July 2016. Accordingly, as of February 22, 2018, we have a total of $1.0 billion available under the current Board repurchase authorizations for additional share repurchases.

During fiscal year 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of its common stock for approximately $100 million. At March 31, 2017, the Company remained authorized to purchase approximately $650 million of its common stock under its current stock repurchase program. In November 2015, the Company entered into and closed on an arrangement with Careal to repurchase 22 million shares of its common stock in a private transaction. The transaction was valued with an effective share repurchase price of $26.81 per share, which represented a 3% discount to the 10-trading day volume weighted average price of the Company\\'s common stock using a reference date of November 5, 2015. The Company\\'s payment to Careal upon closing was reduced by $0.25 per share to account for the Company\\'s dividend that was paid on December 8, 2015 to stockholders of record on November 19, 2015. As a result of the share repurchase and dividend payment, in total the Company paid Careal approximately $590 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 in connection with the 22 million shares repurchased. The transaction was funded with U.S. cash on hand and effectively concluded CA\\'s prior $1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board on May 14, 2014. Including the November 2015 share repurchase arrangement with Careal, the Company repurchased approximately 26 million shares of its common stock for approximately $707 million during fiscal year 2016. Prior to entering into and closing on the share repurchase arrangement, Careal held approximately 28.7% of the Company\\'s total outstanding stock. In connection with the share repurchase arrangement, Careal transferred an additional 37 million shares of the Company\\'s common stock to an entity wholly owned by Martin Haefner, a 50% owner of Careal. Upon completion of the share repurchase arrangement and the share transfer described above, Careal\\'s and Martin Haefner\\'s ownership interests were approximately 16.0% and 8.9%, respectively, of the Company\\'s total outstanding common stock. Thus, Careal and its shareholders collectively owned, directly and indirectly, approximately 24.9% of the Company\\'s total outstanding common stock. In connection with the share repurchase arrangement with Careal, the Company agreed that it will indemnify Careal for certain potential tax matters resulting solely from the Company\\'s breach of the covenant relating to the post-closing holding of the repurchased shares under this arrangement. The Company believes that the occurrence of an event that could trigger the indemnification is within its control and is remote. Therefore, the Company has not recorded a liability related to such indemnification. The maximum potential future payment under this indemnification, excluding interest and penalties, if any, is estimated to be approximately CHF 101 million (which translated to approximately $101 million at March 31, 2017). Any changes to the Company\\'s assessment of the probability of the occurrence of an event that could trigger the indemnification provision may result in the Company recording a liability in the future, which would impact the results of operations for that period. During fiscal year 2015, the Company repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares of its common stock for approximately $215 million. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss: Foreign currency translation losses included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $483 million, $416 million and $418 million, respectively. 85',\n",

Distribution expenses, which are typically higher for non-U.S. products, are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to international fee structures which provide for recovery of certain distribution costs through investment management fees. Sales-based expenses decreased $18.9 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to decreases of $12.4 million from lower average commission rates and $9.0 million from a lower mix of U.S. product commissionable sales. The lower average commission rates primarily resulted from a higher mix of non-U.S. product fixed income sales and tiered pricing on larger trades. Non-U.S. products typically generate lower sales commissions than U.S. products, and fixed income products typically generate lower sales commissions than equity products. Total commissionable sales increased 4%, however the increase resulted from significantly higher sales of non-U.S. products that were largely offset by lower sales of U.S. products; the lower mix of U.S. product commissionable sales resulted in a net decrease in sales-based expenses. Sales-based expenses decreased $146.5 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to $133.7 million from a 29% decrease in commissionable sales. The decrease also included $6.7 million in India primarily related to lower sales and regulatory-driven changes in fee structure, and $6.6 million from lower marketing support expense primarily resulting from the change in fee structure for certain service providers and lower related sales. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $3.2 million and $37.6 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 primarily due to $18.5 million and $25.8 million related to lower sales of U.S. shares sold without a front-end sales charge to investors. The decrease in fiscal year 2017 was substantially offset by $12.7 million of adjustments recognized in fiscal year 2016 related to prior-year amortization expense and $4.3 million from higher sales of non-U.S. shares sold without a front-end sales charge to investors. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefit expenses decreased $27.2 million in fiscal year 2017 due to a $55.7 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits, partially offset by a $28.5 million increase in variable compensation. The decrease in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily due to decreases of $51.4 million in termination benefits and $19.9 million from a higher weighting of employees in lower cost regions outside the U.S., partially offset by an $18.3 million increase for annual merit salary adjustments that were effective December 1, 2016 and 2015. The increase in variable compensation was primarily due to increases of $13.1 million from higher market valuations of mutual fund awards, $13.1 million in bonus expense based on our overall performance and $6.5 million from higher sales-related commissions, partially offset by an $8.3 million decrease in amortization of stock and stock unit awards. Compensation and benefit expenses decreased $92.4 million in fiscal year 2016 due to a $108.4 million decrease in variable compensation, partially offset by a $16.0 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits. The variable compensation decrease was primarily due to $81.2 million related to our lower performance, as well as $8.9 million related to private equity and other product performance fees. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits was primarily due to increases of $55.7 million in termination benefits and $18.0 million for annual merit salary adjustments that were effective December 1, 2015 and 2014, largely offset by decreases of $35.0 million from lower staffing levels and $16.2 million from favorable currency impacts. The increase in termination benefits was primarily due to special benefits related to the voluntary separation of approximately 300 employees. Variable compensation as a percentage of compensation and benefits was 36%, 33% and 38% for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. At September 30, 2017, our global workforce had increased to approximately 9,400 employees from approximately 9,100 at September 30, 2016. We continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. As such, any changes in the underlying performance of our SIPs or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefit expenses going forward. However, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue.',\n",

Investing activities: Cash used in investing activities increased by $400.3 million to $1.96 billion in 2017 from $1.56 billion in 2016. Higher net cash used in investing activities reflects $463.7 million in marketable debt securities as there was $190.8 million in net purchases of marketable debt securities in 2017 compared to $272.9 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities in 2016. In addition, there were higher net originations of retail loans and direct financing leases of $87.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The outflows were partially offset by lower cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of $166.5 million. Financing activities: Cash used in financing activities was $393.8 million in 2017 compared to cash used in financing activities of $823.5 million in 2016. The Company paid $558.3 million in dividends in 2017 compared to $829.3 million in 2016; the decrease of $271.0 million was primarily due to a lower special dividend paid in January 2017 than the special dividend paid in January 2016. In 2016, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $70.5 million, while there were no stock repurchases in 2017. In 2017, the Company issued $1.67 billion of term debt, increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $352.1 million and repaid term debt of $1.90 billion. In 2016, the Company issued $1.99 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.63 billion and reduced its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $322.8 million. This resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $125.2 million in 2017, $78.3 million higher than the cash provided by borrowing activities of $46.9 million in 2016. 2016 Compared to 2015: Operating activities:  Cash provided by operations decreased by $255.2 million to $2.30 billion in 2016. Lower operating cash flows reflect lower net income of $521.7 million in 2016, which includes payment of the $833.0 million EC charge, and higher pension contributions of $122.8 million. This was partially offset by $675.0 million from Financial Services segment wholesale receivables, whereby cash receipts exceeded originations in 2016 ($401.6 million) compared to originations exceeding cash receipts in 2015 ($273.4 million).  In addition, there was a lower cash outflow for payment of income taxes of $281.4 million. Investing activities: Cash used in investing activities decreased by $410.6 million to $1.56 billion in 2016 from $1.97 billion in 2015. Lower net cash used in investing activities reflects $567.2 million from marketable debt securities as there was $272.9 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities in 2016 versus $294.3 million in net purchases of marketable debt securities in 2015 and higher net originations of retail loans and direct financing leases of $100.7 million. This was partially offset by higher cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of $151.2 million and higher payments for property, plant and equipment of $88.5 million. 30',\n",

Stock-Based Employee Compensation We currently have awards outstanding under two stock-based compensation plans, which provide for awards to our officers, directors and key employees. The plans consist of a 2000 Stock Award Plan and a 2008 Equity Plan. Our ability to issue new awards under the 2000 Stock Award Plan terminated in accordance with the terms of the plan in September 2009. The 2008 Equity Plan, as amended, provides for the issuance of up to 14,000,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to grants of (i) incentive and non-qualified stock options, (ii) stock appreciation rights, (iii) stock awards (including time-based and/or performance-based stock awards) and (iv) restricted stock units (including time-based and performance-based restricted stock units). During any calendar year, no one individual (other than non-employee members of our Board of Directors) may be granted awards of more than 500,000 shares and no non-employee member of our Board of Directors may be granted awards with a value in excess of $500,000 at the grant date. Options and restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2017 generally vest in equal installments over four years from the date of grant. In addition, performance shares and performance share units generally vest in three years. With certain limited exceptions, awards are forfeited if the recipient ceases to be an employee before the shares vest. Options are granted at a price not less than the fair value of the shares on the date of grant and expire not later than ten years after the date of grant. Prior to 2012, our officers received a combination of stock options and restricted stock units. Beginning in 2012, our officers instead receive their long-term incentive awards through a combination of performance share units and restricted stock units. Each performance share unit award is expressed as a target number of performance share units based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date the award is issued. The actual number of shares underlying each award (not to exceed 200% of the target number of performance share units) will be determined based upon the Company\\'s achievement of a specified performance target range. In 2017, we issued a target number of 140,542 performance share units, which will vest approximately three years following the award issue date. The performance payout of these grants will be based on return on our invested capital (\"ROIC\") and earnings per share (\"EPS\") for the year ended December 31, 2019, as may be adjusted by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors in early 2020 for events that are outside of management\\'s control. In 2014, we also issued a one-time performance-based equity award to our Chairman & Chief Executive Officer in a target amount of 63,771 performance share units. In February 2016, the Compensation Committee set the payout level for this grant at 165% of target based on our 2015 ROIC performance. As of December 2017, the award is no longer subject to restrictions on transfer. Beginning in 2016, our senior officers meeting certain minimum age and service criteria receive their long-term incentive awards through a combination of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units.

Each unit has a stated amount of $100 and initially consists of a three-year forward stock purchase contract (\"2020 Purchase Contracts\") for the purchase of a variable number of shares of common stock, on May 15, 2020, for a price of $100, and a 10% beneficial ownership interest in one share of 0% Series C Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (\"Series C Preferred Stock\"). The Company received approximately $727.5 million in cash proceeds from the $750 million Equity Units, net of underwriting costs and commissions, before offering expenses, and issued 750,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, recording $750.0 million in preferred stock. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of short-term borrowings. The Company also used $25.1 million of the proceeds to enter into capped call transactions utilized to hedge potential economic dilution as described in more detail below. Convertible Preferred Stock In May 2017, the Company issued 750,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. The convertible preferred stock will initially not bear any dividends and the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock will not accrete. The convertible preferred stock has no maturity date, and will remain outstanding unless converted by holders or redeemed by the Company. Holders of shares of the convertible preferred stock will generally have no voting rights. The Series C Preferred Stock is pledged as collateral to support holders\\' purchase obligations under the 2020 Purchase Contracts and can be remarketed. In connection with any successful remarketing, the Company may (but is not required to) modify certain terms of the convertible preferred stock, including the dividend rate, the conversion rate, and the earliest redemption date. After any successful remarketing in connection with which the dividend rate on the convertible preferred stock is increased, the Company will pay cumulative dividends on the convertible preferred stock, if declared by the board of directors, quarterly in arrears from the applicable remarketing settlement date. On and after May 15, 2020, the Series C Preferred Stock may be converted into common stock at the option of the holder. The initial conversion rate was 6.1627 shares of common stock per one share of Series C Preferred Stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $162.27 per share of common stock. As of December 30, 2017, due to the customary anti-dilution provisions, the conversion rate was 6.1667, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $162.16 per share of common stock. At the election of the Company, upon conversion, the Company may deliver cash, common stock, or a combination thereof. The Company may not redeem the Series C Preferred Stock prior to June 22, 2020. At the election of the Company, on or after June 22, 2020, the Company may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. If the Company calls the Series C Preferred Stock for redemption, holders may convert their shares immediately preceding the redemption date. 2020 Purchase Contracts The 2020 Purchase Contracts obligate the holders to purchase, on May 15, 2020, for a price of $100 in cash, a maximum number of 5.4 million shares of the Company\\'s common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). The 2020 Purchase Contract holders may elect to settle their obligation early, in cash. The Series C Preferred Stock is pledged as collateral to guarantee the holders\\' obligations to purchase common stock under the terms of the 2020 Purchase Contracts. The initial settlement rate determining the number of shares that each holder must purchase will not exceed the maximum settlement rate, and is determined over a market value averaging period immediately preceding May 15, 2020. The initial maximum settlement rate of 0.7241 was calculated using an initial reference price of $138.10, equal to the last reported sale price of the Company\\'s common stock on May 11, 2017. As of December 30, 2017, due to the customary anti-dilution provisions, the maximum settlement rate was 0.7246, equivalent to a reference price of $138.01. If the applicable market value of the Company\\'s common stock is less than or equal to the reference price, the settlement rate will be the maximum settlement rate; and if the applicable market value of common stock is greater than the reference price, the settlement rate will be a number of shares of the Company\\'s common stock equal to $100 divided by the applicable market value. Upon settlement of the 2020 Purchase Contracts, the Company will receive additional cash proceeds of $750 million. The Company will pay the holders of the 2020 Purchase Contracts quarterly payments (\"Contract Adjustment Payments\") at a rate of 5.375% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, commencing August 15, 2017.

Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Administrator will determine all terms and conditions of each Option, including but not limited to: (i) whether the Option is an \"incentive stock option\" which meets the requirements of Code Section 422, or a \"nonqualified stock option\" which does not meet the requirements of Code Section 422; (ii) the number of Shares subject to the Option; (iii) the exercise price, which may not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Option as determined on the date of grant; (iv) the terms and conditions of exercise; and (v) the term, except that an Option must terminate no later than ten (10) years after the date of grant. In all other respects, the terms of any incentive stock option should comply with the provisions of Code Section 422 except to the extent the Administrator determines otherwise.

Current loss estimates (including business interruption) are less than our insurance deductibles, as a result, we do not expect to receive any insurance proceeds. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information regarding our capital requirements and anticipated sources of capital to fund such requirements.

The decrease primarily reflects (i) a $67.6 million reduction due to the impact of foreign exchange translation gains and losses associated with our euro denominated debt, (ii) an $8.5 million increase in interest expense associated with higher outstanding debt balances and (iii) a $7.8 million casualty loss and $5.2 million in incremental tenant reinsurance losses related to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma offset partially by (iv) a $66.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income (described below) and (v) an $18.9 million increase in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities. The $66.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $44.6 million increase in our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) and a $22.3 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 3.0% or $63.0 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 3.4% or $18.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased property taxes, advertising and selling expense and repairs and maintenance costs, offset partially by lower snow removal costs. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 345 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since January 2015. Operating results for 2016 and 2015 In 2016, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1,183.9 million or $6.81 per diluted common share, compared to $1,053.1 million or $6.07 per share in 2015 representing an increase of $130.8 million or $0.74 per share. The increase is primarily due to (i) a $139.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) a $17.3 million increase in foreign exchange translation gains associated with our euro denominated debt offset partially by (iii) a $29.0 million reduction in gains on sales of real estate investments, including our equity share and (iv) a $20.0 million increase in EITF D-42 charges, including our equity share, as a result of preferred redemption activities. The $139.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $104.6 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $34.5 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 5.8% or $117.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 2.5% or $13.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to increased property taxes, on-site property manager payroll and repairs and maintenance, offset partially by lower snow removal costs. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 295 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded in 2015 and 2016.',\n",

The timing and amount of future dividends are subject to the determination of PCA's Board of Directors. On August 31, 2016, PCA announced an increase of its quarterly cash dividend on its common stock from an annual payout of $2.20 per share to an annual payout of $2.52 per share. The first quarterly dividend of $0.63 per share was paid on October 14, 2016 to shareholders of record as of September 15, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $237.6 million of dividends to shareholders.

On February 22, 2017, we made a payment of $1.5 billion to Goldman Sachs from available cash on hand and received an initial delivery of 5.83 million shares of our common stock from Goldman Sachs based on the then current market price of Humana common stock. The payment to Goldman Sachs was recorded as a reduction to stockholders' equity, consisting of a $1.2 billion increase in treasury stock, which reflected the value of the initial 5.83 million shares received upon initial settlement, and a $300 million decrease in capital in excess of par value, which reflected the value of stock held back by Goldman Sachs pending final settlement of the February 2017 ASR. Upon settlement of the February 2017 ASR on August 28, 2017, we received an additional 0.84 million shares as determined by the average daily volume weighted-average share price of our common stock during the term of the agreement of $224.81, bringing the total shares received under this program to 6.67 million. In addition, upon settlement we reclassified the $300 million value of stock initially held back by Goldman Sachs from capital in excess of par value to treasury stock.

On the commitment date, the most favorable conversion price used to measure the beneficial conversion feature of the Preferred Shares was higher than the fair value per ordinary share and therefore no bifurcation of beneficial conversion feature was recognized. The Company determined the fair value of ordinary shares with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm. The Company has elected to recognize the changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the Preferred Shares to equal the redemption value at each reporting period. The changes in redemption value including cumulative dividends shall be recorded as a reduction of income available to ordinary shareholders in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99 3A. The Company concluded that there is no accretion to be recognized because the carrying amount of the Preferred Shares is greater than the redemption value. Therefore, no adjustment will be made to the initial carrying amount of the Preferred Shares until the redemption amount exceeds the carrying amount of the Preferred Shares. 21.

In addition, under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the exercise price for the options must be equal to or greater than the closing price per share of our common stock on the date the award is granted, as reported on Nasdaq.

Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (\"ALTEIP\"), amended and restated in May 2017, the Company is authorized to issue up to 1,500,000 new shares of the Company\\'s common stock to employees, officers and non-employee directors. Under the ALTEIP, the Company may grant awards based on shares of its common stock, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), restricted stock (including performance shares), unrestricted stock, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance share units (\"PSUs\") and dividend equivalents. All future share-based grants will be awarded under the ALTEIP. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the \"Compensation Committee\") awards RSUs and PSUs annually. RSUs and PSUs are promises to issue actual shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period or performance period. The RSUs granted to employees under the ALTEIP are based on salary grade and performance and generally vest one-third each year over a three-year period. RSUs receive dividend equivalents in cash during the restricted period and do not have voting rights during the restricted period. RSUs granted to non-employee directors also vest one-third each year over a three-year period, however, issuance of vested shares and payment of dividend equivalents is deferred until separation from Board service. PSUs accrue dividend equivalents during the performance period based on a target payout, and will be paid in cash at the end of the performance period based on the actual number of shares issued. Under the ALTEIP, the Company\\'s CEO is authorized by the Board of Directors to grant common stock, restricted stock and RSUs to employees other than the executive officers of the Company (as defined in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")). The Compensation Committee recommends the annual share allotment that can be awarded by the CEO under this program. Restricted stock and RSUs granted under this program may have different vesting periods. The fair value of RSUs is estimated using the fair market value of a share of the Company\\'s common stock at the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The number of shares a participant will receive upon vesting of a PSU award is contingent upon the Company\\'s performance with respect to selected metrics, as identified below. The payout levels for 2017 and 2016 awards can vary between 0% and 200% (maximum) of the target (100%) ALTEIP award amount and the payout levels for 2015 awards can vary between 0% and 150% (maximum) of the target (100%) ALTEIP award amount, based on the Company\\'s level of performance against the selected metrics. 2017 and 2016 PSU Performance Goals. The Compensation Committee established total shareholder return and net operating earnings per diluted share, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, as the two equally weighted performance measures for PSU awards in 2017 and 2016. Total shareholder return is defined as appreciation in Company stock plus dividend yield to stockholders and will be measured by the performance of the Company relative to the S&P 500 Index over the three-year performance period. Net operating earnings per diluted share, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, is a Company-specific profitability metric and is defined as the Company\\'s net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the period. This metric is an absolute metric that is measured against a three-year cumulative target established by the Compensation Committee at the award date, and is not tied to the performance of peer companies. 2015 PSU Performance Goals. The Compensation Committee established book value per share (\"BVPS\") growth excluding AOCI, revenue growth and total stockholder return as the three performance measures for PSU awards in 2015. BVPS growth is defined as the year-over-year growth of the Company\\'s stockholders\\' equity excluding AOCI divided by the number of fully diluted total shares outstanding at the end of the period. Revenue growth is defined as the year-over-year change in total revenues as disclosed in the Company\\'s annual statement of operations. Total stockholder return is defined as appreciation in Company stock plus dividend yield to stockholders. Payouts will be determined by measuring performance against the average performance of companies included in an insurance industry market index. The Company is using the S&P Total Market Index to measure the Company\\'s performance for 2015 PSU awards. Adjustments will be made to the S&P Total Market Index to exclude companies with revenues of less than $1.00 billion or that are not in the insurance or managed healthcare Global Industry Classification Standard codes. In addition, companies within the Company\\'s compensation peer group, but not otherwise in the S&P Total Market Index, will be included. In May 2017, the Company modified its outstanding 2015 PSU awards (except those awarded to executive officers of the Company, as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act) to adjust the revenue growth metric for a change in program structure for a large service contract client, which impacted the accounting for revenues on a net instead of a gross basis. The 2015 PSU awards were previously modified in 2016, along with the 2014 PSU awards, to exclude the AEB and Assurant Health segment revenue from the revenue growth metric as a result of the Company\\'s exit of the health insurance market in 2016 and the sale of AEB on March 1, 2016. All other terms of the awards remained unchanged.

Effective March 31, 2015, the Board of Directors terminated this share repurchase program and effective April 1, 2015 the Board of Directors replaced it with a new stock repurchase program authorization in the amount of up to 100 million shares of PNC common stock which may be purchased on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Under this program authorization, we repurchased 18.6 million shares in 2017 and 22.8 million shares in 2016. A maximum amount of 40.7 million shares remained available for repurchase under this program authorization at December 31, 2017.

       " '0001564590-18-002873.html': 'Restricted shares are generally granted at the fair market value of the Company\\'s Common Shares at the date of grant. Restricted shares that have been awarded through December 31, 2017 generally vest three years from the award date. In addition, the Company\\'s unvested restricted shareholders have the same voting rights as any other Common Share holder. During the three-year period of restriction, the Company\\'s unvested restricted shareholders receive quarterly dividend payments on their shares at the same rate and on the same date as any other Common Share holder. As a result, dividends paid on unvested restricted shares are included as a component of retained earnings (included in general partner\\'s capital in the Operating Partnership\\'s financial statements) and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares/Units in a manner similar to the Company\\'s preferred share/preference unit dividends for the earnings per share/Unit calculation. If employment is terminated prior to the lapsing of the restriction, the shares are generally canceled. Restricted units are a class of partnership interests that under certain conditions, including vesting, are convertible by the holder into an equal number of OP Units, which are redeemable by the holder for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis or the cash value of such shares at the option of the Company. In connection with the grant of long-term incentive compensation for services provided during a year, officers of the Company are allowed to choose between restricted shares and restricted units. In January 2011, March 2014 and June 2015, certain holders of restricted shares converted these shares into restricted units. Restricted units are generally granted at a 3% discount to the fair market value of the Company\\'s Common Shares at the date of grant due to the book-up risk associated with restricted units (see below for more details) and generally vest three years from the award date. In addition, restricted unit holders receive quarterly dividend payments on their restricted units at the same rate and on the same date as any other OP Unit holder. As a result, dividends paid on restricted units are included as a component of Noncontrolling Interests - Operating Partnership/Limited Partners\\' capital and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares/Units in a manner similar to the Company\\'s preferred share/preference unit dividends for the earnings per share/Unit calculation. If employment is terminated prior to vesting, the restricted units are generally canceled. A restricted unit will automatically convert to an OP Unit when the capital account of each restricted unit increases (\"books-up\") to a specified target. If the capital target is not attained within ten years following the date of issuance, the restricted unit will automatically be canceled and no compensation will be payable to the holder of such canceled restricted unit. The Company also allows eligible employees the ability to receive immediately vested Options and allows officers the ability to receive immediately vested restricted units (subject to the book-up provisions described above and a two-year hold restriction) in-lieu of any percentage of their annual cash bonus. In January 2015, the Company revised its executive compensation program for the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and certain other Executive Officers. The long-term portion of the revised program will allow these individuals to earn from 0% to 200% of the target number of long-term incentive (\"LTI\") plan awards, payable in the form of restricted shares and/or restricted units, as determined by the Company\\'s relative and absolute Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") over a forward-looking three-year performance period. The Company\\'s TSR will be compared to pre-established quantitative performance metrics. In connection with the grant of LTI plan awards, the individuals are allowed to choose between restricted shares and restricted units. The grant date fair value of the awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo model, and the resulting expense is recorded regardless of whether the TSR performance measures are achieved, if the required service is delivered. These awards generally vest three years from the award date. The grant date fair value is amortized into expense over the service period. If the executive is retirement-eligible, the grant date fair value is amortized into expense over the first year. All other awards are amortized into expense over the three year performance/vesting period. In addition, the awards granted as restricted units will receive quarterly partial dividend payments equal to 10% of any common share dividend on the same date as any other OP Unit holder during the three-year performance period. As a result, dividends paid on restricted units are included as a component of Noncontrolling Interests - Operating Partnership/Limited Partners\\' capital and have not been considered in reducing net income available to Common Shares/Units in a manner similar to the Company\\'s preferred share/preference unit dividends for the earnings per share/Unit calculation. The awards granted as restricted shares will not receive dividends during the three-year performance period. At the end of the three-year performance period, cumulative dividends will be paid for the three-year performance period for any restricted shares or restricted units actually earned, less any dividends already paid on the restricted units. If employment is terminated prior to vesting, the restricted shares and restricted units are generally canceled. Once the Company\\'s absolute and relative TSR is calculated at the end of the three-year performance period, the executive will earn a certain number of restricted shares and/or restricted units. No payout would be made for any return below 50% of the target performance metric. All Trustees, with the exception of the Company\\'s non-executive Chairman and employee Trustees, are granted options, restricted shares and/or restricted units that vest one-year from the grant date that corresponds to the term for which he or she has been elected to serve. The non-executive Chairman only receives awards under the LTI plan (see further discussion above). The Company\\'s Share Incentive Plans provide for certain benefits upon retirement. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, retirement generally means the termination of employment (other than for cause): (i) on or after age 62; or (ii) prior to age 62 after meeting the requirements of the Rule of 70 (described below).

We expect continued growth in our expenditures, particularly those related to research and development, clinical trials, commercialization of new products, international expansion and capital investments. However, we anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, marketable securities available-for-sale, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to fund our operating needs, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and our plans to purchase our stock and pursue strategic business initiatives for the foreseeable future. Many of our operations are conducted outside the United States and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. As of December 31, 2017, we held approximately $6.0 billion of these short-term funds in foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act and the toll charge, we expect to have access to this cash with minimal to no additional U.S. tax impact. Therefore, we no longer consider these funds permanently reinvested offshore. The amount of funds held in U.S. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany transactions, as well as for other reasons, such as repurchases of our common stock, internal reorganizations, business-development activities, restrictions on distributions out of foreign tax jurisdictions and debt issuances. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). Under the 2017 Tax Act, a company's post-1986 previously untaxed foreign E&P are mandatorily deemed to be repatriated and taxed, which is also referred to as the toll charge. The toll charge is assessed regardless of whether or not a company has cash in its foreign subsidiaries and irrespective of whether the company will actually bring back its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings. However, the charge can be paid in installments over eight years. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax expense of $1,890 million which represents the toll charge liability for the deemed repatriation of E&P. We have elected to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years, or through 2025. However, the toll charge liability is not discounted on our financial statements. As such, we have recorded $1,732 million and $150 million as a non-current and current income tax liability, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. In prior years, we recorded U.S. deferred tax liabilities of $317 million for certain offshore earnings that were expected to be remitted to our domestic operations. These deferred tax liabilities reduced the income tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the toll charge. The remaining amounts earned overseas were expected to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States, and therefore, no accrual for U.S. taxes was provided. Share Repurchase Program: Since April 2009, our Board of Directors has approved an aggregate $20.5 billion common stock repurchase program of which we have approximately $822 million remaining for future repurchases as of December 31, 2017.

An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $1.02 billion primarily due to the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. Given the availability of foreign tax credits, the company does not expect the transition tax to result in significant cash requirements. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $274 million due to the timing of payments. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $362 million and $81 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies. An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of income tax refunds.

The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $750 million of the company's common stock and the payment of $237 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $128 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On July 7, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.50 billion of the company's common stock. At February 28, 2018, $500 million was available for future repurchases of the company's common stock under this authorization. In January 2018, the company issued additional commercial paper obligations and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay the $450 million principal balance of the 2.15% Senior Notes due 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the company's short-term debt totaled $2.14 billion, including $960 million of commercial paper obligations and $1.17 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months.

If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $77 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company's cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. A portion of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that are permanently reinvested and which the company plans to use to support continued growth plans outside of the U.S. through funding operations and other investment and growth opportunities. The majority of these funds are only available for use by the company's U.S. operations if they are repatriated into the U.S. The funds repatriated would be subject to additional state and foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation; however, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax liabilities that would be incurred. The company currently has no plans to repatriate these funds held by its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.34 billion as of December 31, 2017 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2016 Cash provided by operating activities was $3.26 billion during 2016. An increase in accounts receivable used cash of $352 million primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies and due to the mid-month timing of the acquisition of FEI when receivables are commonly lower than at quarter-end. Inventories provided cash of $98 million due to a reduction associated with fourth quarter 2016 sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of payments.

The program authorizes the repurchase of the Company's common stock in the open-market or through private transactions through the end of 2018. In October 2017, Anadarko entered into an ASR Agreement to repurchase $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock as part of the $3.0 Billion Share-Repurchase Program. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid $1.0 billion in cash and received an initial delivery of 15.7 million shares of the Company's common stock. The initial delivery of shares represented the minimum number of shares to be repurchased under the agreement. Upon completion of the transaction in December 2017, the Company received an additional 5.1 million shares as determined by the volume-weighted average price of the shares during the term less a negotiated settlement price adjustment. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for $59 million through open-market purchases. At December 31, 2017, the Company had repurchased 21.9 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion (average price of $48.33 per share) under an ASR Agreement and through open-market purchases. These transactions were accounted for as equity transactions, with all of the repurchased shares classified as treasury stock. Additionally, the receipt of these shares reduced the average number of shares of common stock outstanding used to compute both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS). In February 2018, Anadarko completed a repurchase of 8.5 million shares for $500 million (average price of $58.82 per share) under an additional ASR Agreement. In September 2016, the Company completed a public offering of 40.5 million shares of its common stock at a price of $53.23 per share. Net proceeds of $2.16 billion from this equity issuance were primarily used to fund the GOM Acquisition, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes.

These plans (the \"Assumed Plans\") operate in a similar manner to the Company\\'s 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan, and no further equity awards will be issued under any of the Assumed Plans. The 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, restricted stock, PSUs or any other stock-based award and cash based awards.

In connection with the Company\\'s assumption of options issued pursuant to the Assumed Plans, the number of shares underlying each option and exercise price of each option were adjusted to reflect the substitution of the Company\\'s stock for the stock of the applicable acquired company. RSUs issued under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan provide for the issuance of a share of the Company\\'s common stock at no cost to the holder.

The 2016 Plan also allows us to provide equity compensation to our non-employee directors. No more than 55 million shares of our common stock may be issued under the 2016 Plan. For stock options and SARs, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan will be reduced by one share for each share of our common stock in respect of which the award is granted. For stock awards (including restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards), the number of shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan will be reduced by 2.41 shares for each share of our common stock in respect of which the award is granted. Shares subject to awards under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, terminated or expire unexercised become available for future grants. In addition, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan will not be increased by shares tendered to satisfy the purchase price of an award, exchanged for other awards or withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations. Shares issued as a result of awards granted under the 2016 Plan are generally funded out of common stock held in treasury, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new common shares are issued. After approval of the 2016 Plan, no new grants were or will be made from any prior plans. Any awards previously granted under any prior plans shall continue to be exercisable in accordance with their original terms and conditions. Stock-based awards under the plans Stock options - We grant stock options under the 2016 Plan. Our stock options represent the right to purchase shares of our common stock at its fair market value on the date of grant. In general, our stock options vest ratably over a three-year period and have a maximum term of ten years from the date they are granted. SARs - At December 31, 2017, there are no SARs outstanding. Restricted stock - We grant restricted stock under the 2016 Plan. The restricted stock awards granted to officers generally vest three years from the date of grant, contingent on the recipient\\'s continued employment. We also grant restricted stock to certain non-officer employees based on their performance within certain guidelines and for retention purposes. The restricted stock awards to non-officers generally vest ratably over a three-year period, contingent on the recipient\\'s continued employment. Prior to vesting, all restricted stock recipients have the right to vote such stock and receive dividends thereon. The non-vested shares of restricted stock are not transferable and are held by our transfer agent. Stock-based performance units - We grant stock-based performance units to officers under the 2016 Plan. At the grant date, each unit represents the value of one share of our common stock. These units are settled in cash, and the amount of the payment is based on (1) the vesting percentage, which can be from zero to 200% based on performance achieved and (2) the value of our common stock on the date vesting is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The performance goals are tied to our total shareholder return (\"TSR\") as compared to TSR for a group of peer companies determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

However, in this case the holders of preferred stock will not be entitled to any other or further payment. In addition, the rights of the preferred stock in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up shall not restrict or prevent the Company from paying dividends on common stock if the payment of such dividends is not restricted by any other terms of the preferred stock. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up amounts available for payment are insufficient to permit the payment in full of the respective amounts to which the holders of all outstanding preferred stock are entitled, the amount available will be distributed among the holders of each series of preferred stock in an amount proportional to the full amounts to which the holders of each series are entitled. Redemption. All shares of any series of preferred stock may be redeemable to the extent determined by our board of directors. Conversion or Exchange.

The charges consisted of (i) $8 million at our Destination Network segment which primarily focused on enhancing organizational efficiency and rationalizing its operations, (ii) $6 million at our corporate operations which focused on rationalizing its sourcing function and outsourcing certain information technology functions and (iii) $1 million at our Hotel Group segment which primarily focused on realigning its brand operations. During 2017, we reduced our restructuring-charge liability by $11 million, of which $10 million was in cash payments and $1 million was through the issuance of Wyndham stock. The remaining liability of $4 million, as of December 31, 2017, is expected to be paid by the end of 2018. We anticipate annual net savings from such initiatives to be $24 million. During 2016, we recorded $14 million of charges related to restructuring initiatives, primarily focused on enhancing organizational efficiency and rationalizing existing facilities including the closure of four vacation ownership sales offices. In connection with these initiatives, we initially recorded $11 million of personnel-related costs, a $2 million non-cash asset impairment charge and $2 million of facility-related expenses. In 2016, we subsequently reversed $1 million of previously recorded personnel-related costs and reduced our liability with $5 million of cash payments. During 2017, we reduced our remaining liability by $7 million, of which $6 million was in cash payments. The remaining liability of $1 million as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be paid primarily by the end of 2020. During 2015, we recorded $6 million of charges related to restructuring initiatives resulting from a realignment of brand services and call center operations within our hotel group business, a rationalization of international operations within our destination network business and a reorganization of the sales function within our vacation ownership business. In connection with these initiatives, we initially recorded $7 million of personnel-related costs and a $1 million non-cash asset impairment charge associated with a facility. We subsequently reversed $2 million of previously recorded personnel-related costs and reduced our liability with $2 million of cash payments. During 2016, we reduced our remaining liability with $3 million of cash payments. We have additional restructuring plans which were implemented prior to 2015. During 2017, we reduced our remaining liability for such plans with $1 million of cash payments.

Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, with respect to the election of directors, holders of Class A Common Stock vote as a class with the holders of Class C Common Stock, and holders of Class B Common Stock vote as a class with holders of Class D Common Stock, with holders of all classes of our Common Stock entitled to one vote per share. As of March 21, 2017, the shares of Class A and Class C Common Stock constituted 7.5% of the aggregate outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect five members of the Board of Directors and constituted 86.5% of our general voting power as of that date. As of March 21, 2017, the shares of Class B and Class D Common Stock (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options) constituted 92.5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, had the right to elect two members of the Board of Directors and constituted 13.5% of our general voting power as of that date. As to matters other than the election of directors, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Common Stock all vote together as a single class, except as otherwise provided by law. Each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote; each share of Class B Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one-tenth of a vote; each share of Class C Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes (provided the holder of Class C Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that holder holds); and each share of Class D Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes (provided the holder of Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Class D Common Stock that holder holds). In the event a holder of Class C or Class D Common Stock holds a number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, less than ten times the number of shares of Class C or Class D Common Stock that holder holds, then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of Class C Common Stock, or one-tenth of a vote for every share of Class D Common Stock, which that holder holds in excess of one-tenth the number of shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock, respectively, held by that holder. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of Class A or Class B Common Stock as Class C or Class D Common Stock, respectively, if such facts are not apparent from our stock records. Since a substantial majority of the Class A shares and Class C shares are controlled by Mr. Alan B. Miller and members of his family, one of whom (Marc D. Miller) is also a director and officer of our company, and they can elect a majority of our company's directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders, there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company. In addition, because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, our business and prospects and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.\",\n",
       " '0000101829-18-000005.html': 'We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. In particular, following the announcement of the proposed Rockwell Collins acquisition, the credit rating agencies announced that they were reviewing our credit ratings for possible downgrades. Quarterly Cash Dividends and Share Repurchases May Be Discontinued or Modified, Are Subject to a Number of Uncertainties and May Affect the Price of Our Common Stock.   Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with free operating cash flow, borrowings and divestitures. However, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. Dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company\\'s stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. To help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the pending Rockwell Collins acquisition, we have, among other things, suspended share repurchases, excluding activity relating to our employee savings plans. As we continue to assess the impacts of the TCJA, future opportunities for repatriation of our non-U.S. earnings, and accelerated de-leveraging, we may consider, in addition to investments in our operations, limited additional share repurchases to offset the effects of dilution related to our stock-based compensation programs - see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2017 Annual Report. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\\'s effectiveness.

We Design, Manufacture and Service Products that Incorporate Advanced Technologies; The Introduction of New Products and Technologies Involves Risks and We May Not Realize the Degree or Timing of Benefits Initially Anticipated. We seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. The product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. Of particular note, Pratt & Whitney is currently producing and delivering the PurePower PW1000G Geared TurboFan engine to power various aircraft, including the A320neo family of aircraft, which entered into service in January 2016. The level of orders received for the PurePower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. If any of our production ramp-up efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, and/or if we identify or experience issues with in-service engines, we may not meet customers\\' production schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including penalties that could be assessed under existing contractual provisions. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability 15',\n",

Anything in this Section 4.02 to the contrary notwithstanding, neither Automotive nor any Automotive Subsidiary shall have any liability whatsoever to either BWC or any BWC Subsidiary in respect of any Tax, except as otherwise provided in Schedule B hereto, in the Benefits Agreement or in the Tax Sharing Agreement. Section 4.03     Limitations on Indemnification Obligations. The amount which any party (an \"Indemnifying Party\") is or may be required to pay to any other party (an \"Indemnitee\") pursuant to Section 4.01 or Section 4.02 shall be reduced (including, without limitation, retroactively) by any Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, in reduction of the related Loss. If an Indemnitee shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss and shall subsequently actually receive Insurance Proceeds or other amounts in respect of such Loss, then such Indemnitee shall pay to such Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually received (up to but not in excess of the amount of any indemnity payment made hereunder). An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto, or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to a \"windfall\" (i.e., a benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. Section 4.04     Procedures for Indemnification. Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party Claims. Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party Claims shall be as follows: (a)    If an Indemnitee shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a person (including, without limitation, any governmental entity) who is not a party to this Agreement or to the Tax Sharing Agreement of any claim or of the commencement by any such person of any Action (a \"Third Party Claim\") with respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 4.01, 4.02 or any other Section of this Agreement, such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof promptly after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as provided in this Section 4.04(a) shall not relieve the related Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article IV, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and, if ascertainable, shall indicate the amount (estimated if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by such Indemnitee. (b)    An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend or to seek to settle or compromise, at such Indemnifying Party\\'s own expense and by such Indemnifying Party\\'s own counsel, any Third Party Claim. Within 30 days of the receipt of notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 4.04(a) (or sooner, if the nature of such Third Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third Party Claim, which election shall specify any reservations or exceptions. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnitee under this Article IV for any legal or other expenses (except expenses approved in advance by the Indemnifying Party) subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof; provided that if the defendants in any such claim include both the Indemnifying Party and one or more Indemnitees and in any Indemnitee\\'s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between one or more of such Indemnitees and such Indemnifying Party exists in respect of such claim or if the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed responsibility for such claim with any reservations or exceptions, such Indemnitees shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent such Indemnitees and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (but not more than one separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) shall be paid by such Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in this Section 4.04(b), such Indemnitee may defend or (subject to the remainder of this Section 4.04(b)) seek to compromise or settle such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither an Indemnifying Party nor an Indemnitee may settle or compromise any claim over the objection of the other; provided, however, that consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld. Neither an Indemnifying Party nor an Indemnitee shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee, in the case of a consent or settlement by an Indemnifying Party, or the Indemnifying Party, in the case of a consent or settlement by the Indemnitee, of a written release from all liability in respect to such Third Party Claim. (c)    If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise or settle any Third Party Claim, the related Indemnitee shall make available to such Indemnifying Party any personnel or any books, records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make available that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, settlement or compromise, and shall otherwise cooperate in the defense, settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claims. (d)    Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.04 to the contrary, if an Indemnifying Party notifies the related Indemnitee in writing of such Indemnifying Party\\'s desire to settle or compromise a Third Party Claim on the basis set forth in such notice (provided that such settlement or compromise includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff of a written release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect thereof) and the Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing that such Indemnitee declines to accept any such settlement or compromise, such Indemnitee may continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any participation by such Indemnifying Party, at such Indemnitee\\'s sole expense. In such event, the obligation of such Indemnifying Party to such Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim shall be equal to (i) the costs and expenses of such Indemnitee prior to the date such Indemnifying Party notifies such Indemnitee of the offer to settle or compromise (to the extent such costs and expenses are otherwise indemnifiable hereunder) plus (ii) the lesser of (A) the amount of any offer of settlement or compromise which such Indemnitee declined to accept and (B) the actual out-of-pocket amount such Indemnitee is obligated to pay subsequent to such date as a result of such Indemnitee\\'s continuing to pursue such Third Party Claim. (e)    Any claim on account of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to the related Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30 days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30 day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to make payment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30 day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party under this Agreement or under applicable law. (f)    In addition to any adjustments required pursuant to Section 4.03, if the amount of any Loss shall, at any time subsequent to the payment required by this Agreement, be reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise, the amount of such reduction, less any expenses incurred in connection therewith, shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. (g)    In the event of payment by an Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right or claim relating to such Third Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third Party Claim or against any other person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right or claim. Section 4.05     Remedies Cumulative. The remedies provided in this Article IV shall be cumulative and shall not preclude assertion by any Indemnitee of any other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against any Indemnifying Party. Section 4.06     Survival of Indemnities. The obligations of BWC and Automotive under this Article IV shall survive the sale or other transfer by it of any assets or businesses or the assignment by it of any Liabilities, with respect to any Loss of the other related to such assets, businesses or Liabilities. ARTICLE V ACCESS TO INFORMATION Section 5.01     Access to Information. From and after the Distribution Date, BWC shall afford to Automotive and its authorized accountants, counsel and other designated representatives (collectively, \"Representatives\") reasonable access (including using reasonable efforts to give access to persons or firms possessing information) and duplicating rights during normal business hours to all records, books, contracts, instruments, computer data and other data and information (collectively, \"Information\") within BWC\\'s possession relating to Automotive or any Automotive Subsidiary, insofar as such access is reasonably required by Automotive or any Automotive Subsidiary.

Section 5.03     Retention of Records. Except as otherwise required by law or agreed to in writing, each of BWC and Automotive shall retain, and shall cause its subsidiaries to retain following the Distribution Date, for a period consistent with the document retention policies in effect at BWC and Automotive, respectively, all significant Information relating to the business of the other and the other\\'s subsidiaries. In addition, after the expiration of the applicable periods, such Information shall not be destroyed or otherwise disposed of at any time, unless, prior to such destruction or disposal, (a) the party proposing to destroy or otherwise dispose of such Information shall provide no less than 30 days\\' prior written notice to the other, specifying in reasonable detail the Information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of and (b) if a recipient of such notice shall request in writing prior to the scheduled date for such destruction or disposal that any of the Information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of be delivered to such requesting party, the party proposing the destruction or disposal shall promptly arrange for the delivery of such of the Information as was requested at the expense of the party requesting such Information. Section 5.04     Confidentiality. Each of BWC and the BWC Subsidiaries on the one hand, and Automotive and the Automotive Subsidiaries on the other hand, shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to hold, in strict confidence, all Information concerning the other in its possession or furnished by the other or the other\\'s Representatives pursuant to either this Agreement or the Tax Sharing Agreement (except to the extent that such Information has been (a) in the public domain through no fault of such party or (b) later lawfully acquired from other sources by such party), and each party shall not release or disclose such Information to any other person, except its auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, bankers and other consultants and advisors, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or, as advised by its counsel, by other requirements of law.',\n",

Stock-Based Compensation Plans Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders. In addition, members of our Board of Directors participate in our stock-based compensation program in connection with their service on our board. Share-based awards issued to employees include non-qualified stock options, restricted stock unit awards and performance share unit awards. Under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the number of shares initially available for awards was 18 million. As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 7 million shares of common stock available for future grants. Total share-based compensation costs recognized for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $21 million, $18 million, and $15 million, respectively. The unamortized compensation expense at December 31, 2017 related to our stock options, restricted share units and performance share units was $6 million, $17 million and $13 million, respectively, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.8 years, respectively. The amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $16 million for 2017 with a tax benefit of $10 million realized associated with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units. We classify as an operating activity the cash flows attributable to excess tax benefits arising from stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vestings. Stock Option Grants Options are awarded with a contractual term of ten years and generally vest over a three-year period and are exercisable within the contractual term, except in certain instances of death, retirement or disability. The exercise price per share is the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date each option is granted. At December 31, 2017, there were options to purchase an aggregate of 2.1 million shares of common stock. The following is a summary of the changes in outstanding stock options for 2017:\",\n",

The year ended December 31, 2016 includes a $7 million charge recognized in general and administrative expenses primarily resulting from the termination of the Company\\'s former chief executive officer (\"CEO\") that was comprised of the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units in accordance with the terms of the former CEO\\'s employment agreement. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was $20 million and $14 million, respectively, related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company\\'s incentive plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of three years associated with future employee service. Conversion of Equity Awards at the Spin-Off Date The Plans were established with anti-dilution provisions, such that in the event of an equity restructuring of the Company (including spin-off transactions), equity awards would preserve their value post-transaction. In order to achieve an equitable modification of the existing awards following the Spin-Off, the Company converted pre-spin awards to their post-spin value, resulting in grants to remaining employees denominated solely in the Company\\'s common stock. The modification assumed a conversion ratio on all awards calculated as the final pre-spin closing price of the Company\\'s common stock divided by the five trading day average post-spin closing price (\"Five Day Average Price\") of the Company\\'s common stock. The conversion impacted 133 participants, resulted in additional awards being granted and incremental fair value of unvested awards due to the difference between the Five Day Average Price and the pre-spin closing price on the Spin-Off date. The vesting periods were unchanged for unvested grants at the Spin-Off date. The incremental fair value of unvested awards was immaterial. Stock Options Stock options are granted with an exercise price per share equal to the closing market price of the Company\\'s common stock on the grant date. Stock options generally vest ratably over a three- to five-year period and have a 10-year contractual term. Vesting of certain stock options may accelerate, as provided in the Plans or in the applicable award agreement, upon retirement, a change in control or other specified events. There have been no grants of stock options since 2014. Stock options outstanding and exercisable were 1.1 million at December 31, 2017, and 1.3 million and 1.2 million at December 31, 2016, respectively. Proceeds received from stock options exercised under the Plans for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1 million, $4 million and $28 million, respectively. Compensation expense related to stock options was immaterial for all periods presented. Restricted Stock Awards Under the Plans, restricted stock awards, including restricted stock units and performance stock units are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Restrictions on certain awards generally lapse, as provided in the Plans or in the applicable award agreement, upon retirement, a change in control or other specified events. The fair market value of restricted stock awards, both time vesting and those subject to specific performance criteria, are expensed over the period of vesting. Restricted stock units, which vest based solely upon passage of time generally vest over a period of three to six years. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing market price of the Company\\'s shares on the grant date. Performance stock units, which are restricted stock awards that vest dependent upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed targeted levels, generally vest in their entirety at the end of a three year performance period. The number of shares that ultimately vest can vary from 0% to 200% of target depending on the level of achievement of the performance criteria. The fair value of performance stock units is determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation model. The compensation expense recognized for all restricted stock awards is net of actual forfeitures. Upon vesting of restricted stock awards, the participant is required to pay the related tax withholding obligation. Participants can generally elect to have the Company reduce the number of common stock shares delivered to pay the employee tax withholding obligation. The value of the shares withheld is dependent on the closing market price of the Company\\'s common stock on the trading date prior to the relevant transaction occurring. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company withheld 157,000, 237,000 and 200,000 shares, respectively, to offset tax withholding obligations with respect to the vesting of the restricted stock and performance restricted stock unit awards. Holders of restricted stock awards, including restricted stock units and performance stock units, are generally entitled to receive dividends equal to the amount that would be paid on an equivalent number of shares of common stock. 105',\n",

This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of two rates selected by Applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance at October 29, 2017. Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $70 million are with Japanese banks. Applied's ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both October 29, 2017 and October 30, 2016, and Applied has not utilized these credit facilities.

Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company, including market conditions, the trading price of the Company\\'s common stock and determinations by the Company of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. In conjunction with CEP IV, the Company engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 2.0% of the gross sales price for shares sold. The Company expects that, if entered into, it will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates specified by the Company on or prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case the Company will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, the Company may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. In connection with each forward sale agreement, the Company will pay the relevant forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, commission of up to 2.0% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. As of December 31, 2017, there are no outstanding forward sales agreements. In 2017, the Company sold 568,424 shares at an average sales price of $188.39 per share, for net proceeds of $105,478,000.

Following this exchange, approximately $194.2 million of existing St. Jude Medical notes remain outstanding across the five series of existing notes which have the same coupons and maturities as those listed above. There were no significant costs associated with the exchange of debt. In addition, during the first quarter of 2017, Abbott assumed and subsequently repaid approximately $2.8 billion of various St. Jude Medical debt obligations. In November 2016, Abbott issued $15.1 billion of medium and long-term debt to primarily fund the cash portion of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. Abbott issued $2.85 billion of 2.35% Senior Notes due November 22, 2019; $2.85 billion of 2.90% Senior Notes due November 30, 2021; $1.50 billion of 3.40% Senior Notes due November 30, 2023; $3.00 billion of 3.75% Senior Notes due November 30, 2026; $1.65 billion of 4.75% Senior Notes due November 30, 2036; and $3.25 billion of 4.90% Senior Notes due November 30, 2046. In November 2016, Abbott also entered into interest rate swap contracts totaling $3.0 billion related to the new debt; the swaps have the effect of changing Abbott's obligation from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate obligation on the related debt instruments. In April 2016, Abbott obtained a commitment for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility for an amount not to exceed $17.2 billion, comprised of $15.2 billion for a 364-day bridge loan and $2.0 billion for a 120-day bridge loan to provide financing for the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. The $15.2 billion component of the commitment terminated in November 2016 when Abbott issued the $15.1 billion of long-term debt. In December 2016, Abbott formalized the $2.0 billion component and entered into a 120-day bridge term loan facility that provided Abbott the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion on an unsecured basis to partially fund the St. Jude Medical acquisition. On January 4, 2017, as part of funding the cash portion of the St. Jude Medical acquisition, Abbott borrowed $2.0 billion under the 120-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility. This facility was repaid during the first quarter of 2017. In February 2016, Abbott obtained a commitment for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility for an amount not to exceed $9 billion in conjunction with its pending acquisition of Alere. This commitment, which was automatically extended for up to 90 days on January 29, 2017, expired on April 30, 2017 and was not renewed since Abbott did not need this bridge facility to finance the Alere acquisition. The fees associated with the bridge facilities were recognized in interest expense. In March 2015, Abbott issued $2.5 billion of long-term debt consisting of $750 million of 2.00% Senior Notes due March 15, 2020; $750 million of 2.55% Senior Notes due March 15, 2022; and $1.0 billion of 2.95% Senior Notes due March 15, 2025. Proceeds from this debt were used to pay down short-term borrowings. In March 2015, Abbott also entered into interest rate swap contracts totaling $2.5 billion. These contracts have the effect of changing Abbott's obligation from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate obligation. In September 2014, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Abbott's common shares from time to time. The 2014 authorization was in addition to the $512 million unused portion of a previous program announced in June 2013. In 2016, Abbott repurchased 10.4 million shares at a cost of $408 million under the program authorized in 2014. In 2015, Abbott repurchased 11.3 million shares at a cost of $512 million under the unused portion of the 2013 authorization and 36.2 million shares at a cost of $1.7 billion under the program authorized in 2014 for a total of 47.5 million shares at a cost of $2.2 billion. On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. Abbott declared dividends of $1.075 per share in 2017 compared to $1.045 per share in 2016, an increase of approximately 3%. Dividends paid were $1.849 billion in 2017 compared to $1.539 billion in 2016.

The stock repurchase program allows for the repurchase of $3,500 million of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock, excluding fees and expenses, through December 31, 2019. In March 2017, we entered into accelerated stock repurchase agreements, referred to collectively as the March ASR, with certain financial institutions under our stock repurchase program. Under the terms of the ASR and in exchange for up-front payments of $1,500 million, the financial institutions delivered 23.7 million shares. The March ASR was completed in August 2017. The final number of shares repurchased was based on the final volume-weighted average price of the Company's Class A common stock during the purchase period less the negotiated discount. In December 2017, we entered into another accelerated stock repurchase agreement, or December ASR, with a financial institution under our stock repurchase program. Under the terms of the December ASR and in exchange for an up-front payment of $300 million, the financial institution initially delivered 3.6 million shares, a portion of the Company's total expected shares to be repurchased under the December ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered will be determined in the first quarter of 2018, at the end of the applicable purchase period. The combined March ASR and December ASR were accounted for as a $630 million reduction in common stock and additional paid-in capital and a $1,170 million reduction in retained earnings in our consolidated statements of financial position.

As of April 29, 2017, 13,642 shares remain available under the current repurchase authorization. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") During 1990, Patterson\\'s Board of Directors adopted a leveraged ESOP. In fiscal 1991, under the provisions of the plan and related financing arrangements, Patterson loaned the ESOP $22,000 (the \"1990 note\") for the purpose of acquiring its then outstanding preferred stock, which was subsequently converted to common stock. The Board of Directors determines the contribution from the Company to the ESOP annually. The contribution is used to retire a portion of the debt, which triggers a release of shares that are then allocated to the employee participants. Shares of stock acquired by the plan are allocated to each participant who has completed 1000 hours of service during the plan year. In fiscal 2011, the final payment on the 1990 note was made and all remaining shares were released for allocation to participants. In fiscal 2002, Patterson\\'s ESOP and an ESOP sponsored by the Thompson Dental Company (\"Thompson\") were used to facilitate the acquisition and merger of Thompson into Patterson. The net result of this transaction was an additional loan of $12,612 being made to the ESOP and the ESOP acquiring 666 shares of common stock. The loan bears interest at current rates but principal did not begin to amortize until fiscal 2012. Beginning in fiscal 2012 and through fiscal 2020, an annual payment of $200 plus interest is due and in fiscal 2020, a final payment of any outstanding principal and interest balance is due. Prepayments of principal can be made at any time without penalty. Of the 666 shares issued in the transaction, 98 were previously allocated to Thompson employees. The remaining 568 shares began to be allocated in fiscal 2004 as interest was paid on the loan. In September 2006, we entered into a third loan agreement with the ESOP and loaned $105,000 (the \"2006 note\") for the sole purpose of enabling the ESOP to purchase shares of our common stock. The ESOP purchased 3,160 shares with the proceeds from the 2006 note. Interest on the unpaid principal balance accrues at a rate equal to six-month LIBOR, with the rate resetting semi-annually. Interest payments were not required during the period from and including September 11, 2006 through April 30, 2010. On April 30, 2010, accrued and unpaid interest was added to the outstanding principal balance under the note, with interest thereafter accruing on the increased principal amount. Unpaid interest accruing after April 30, 2010 is due and payable on each successive April 30 occurring through September 10, 2026. Principal payments aren\\'t due until September 10, 2026; however, prepayments can be made without penalty. In fiscal 2012, Patterson contributed $20,214 to the ESOP, which then purchased 844 shares for allocation to the participants. No shares secured by the 2006 note were released prior to fiscal 2011.

The MPC 2012 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of our board of directors (\"Committee\") to grant non-qualified or incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards (including restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards), cash awards and performance awards to our employees and non-employee directors. Under the MPC 2012 Plan, no more than 50 million shares of our common stock may be delivered and no more than 20 million shares of our common stock may be the subject of awards that are not stock options or stock appreciation rights. In the sole discretion of the Committee, 20 million shares of our common stock may be granted as incentive stock options. Shares issued as a result of awards granted under these plans are funded through the issuance of new MPC common shares. Prior to April 26, 2012, our employees and non-employee directors were eligible to receive equity awards under the Marathon Petroleum Corporation 2011 Second Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan (\"MPC 2011 Plan\"). Stock-based awards under the Plans We expense all share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Stock Options - We grant stock options to certain officer and non-officer employees. All of the stock options granted in 2017 fell under the MPC 2012 Plan. Stock options awarded under the MPC 2011 Plan and the MPC 2012 Plan represent the right to purchase shares of our common stock at its fair market value, which is the closing price of MPC\\'s common stock on the date of grant. Stock options have a maximum term of ten years from the date they are granted, and vest over a requisite service period of three years. We use the Black Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units - We grant restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. In general, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to employees vest over a requisite service period of three years. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted after 2011 to officers are subject to an additional one year holding period after the three-year vesting period. Restricted stock recipients who received grants in 2012 and after have the right to vote such stock; however, dividends are accrued and will be paid upon vesting. Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors are considered to vest immediately at the time of the grant for accounting purposes, as they are non-forfeitable, but are not issued until the director\\'s departure from the board of directors. Restricted stock unit recipients do not have the right to vote such shares and receive dividend equivalents payable upon vesting. The non-vested shares are not transferable and are held by our transfer agent. The fair values of restricted stock are equal to the market price of our common stock on the grant date. Performance Units - We grant performance unit awards to certain officer employees. Performance units are dollar denominated. The target value of all performance units is $1.00, with actual payout up to $2.00 per unit (up to 200 percent of target). Performance units issued under the MPC 2012 Plan have a 36-month requisite service period. The payout value of these awards will be determined by the relative ranking of the total shareholder return (\"TSR\") of MPC common stock compared to the TSR of a select group of peer companies, as well as the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Energy Index fund over an average of four measurement periods. These awards will be settled 25 percent in MPC common stock and 75 percent in cash. The number of shares actually distributed will be determined by dividing 25 percent of the final payout by the closing price of MPC common stock on the day the Committee certifies the final TSR rankings, or the next trading day if the certification is made outside of normal trading hours. The performance units paying out in cash are accounted for as liability awards and recorded at fair value with a mark-to-market adjustment made each quarter. The performance units that settle in shares are accounted for as equity awards. 130',\n",

Corporate recorded an $8 million increase to income tax expense resulting from the effect of the lower corporate tax rate on net deferred tax assets. Net results decreased $19 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to the changes discussed above. 2016 Compared with 2015 Net investment income increased $124 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to improved performance of equity based investments and fixed income investments in the trading portfolio and improved results from limited partnership investments. Operating expenses increased $15 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to expenses related to the 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan, which was approved by shareholders on May 10, 2016. Net results improved $68 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to the changes discussed above.

In 2017, we received $804 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, including a special dividend from CNA of $485 million. Cash outflows included the payment of $620 million to fund the acquisition of Consolidated Container, which was in addition to approximately $600 million of debt financing proceeds at the subsidiary level as discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. In addition, cash outflows included the payment of $84 million of cash dividends to our shareholders and $216 million to fund treasury stock purchases. As a holding company we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries and returns on our investment portfolio to fund our obligations. We are not responsible for the liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries and there are no Parent Company guarantees.

The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $1.2 billion decrease were approximately $21.1 billion of cash generated from operating activities and $0.3 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents offset by $14.9 billion net cash used by investing activities and $7.7 billion net cash used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $0.5 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2017 and $22.9 billion at the end of 2016. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations of $21.1 billion was the result of $1.3 billion of net earnings and $9.8 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, assets write-downs and deferred tax provision, reduced by $1.3 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses and $1.0 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in other current and non-current assets. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $12.3 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a decrease in inventories and an increase in other current and non-current liabilities. The increase in accrued liabilities and non-current liabilities is primarily due to the 2017 U.S. tax legislation (TCJA). The U.S. tax of $10.1 billion is payable over 8 years. Additionally, foreign taxes of $3.4 billion, net were recorded in the deferred tax provision. Investing activities use of $14.9 billion was for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $35.2 billion (primarily the acquisitions of Actelion and AMO for approximately $29.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively) and additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.3 billion. This was partially offset by proceeds from the net sale of investments primarily marketable securities of $22.0 billion and $1.8 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses (primarily the divestitures of Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED®). Financing activities use of $7.7 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.9 billion, $6.4 billion for the repurchase of common stock and $0.2 billion of other financing. Financing activities also included sources of $6.8 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.1 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net.

       " '0000829224-17-000049.html': \"Table of Contents Income Taxes We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. Starbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Stock Split On April 9, 2015, we effected a two-for-one stock split of our $0.001 par value common stock for shareholders of record as of March 30, 2015. All share and per-share data in our consolidated financial statements and notes has been retroactively adjusted to reflect this stock split. We adjusted shareholders' equity to reflect the stock split by reclassifying an amount equal to the par value of the additional shares arising from the split from retained earnings to common stock during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, resulting in no net impact to shareholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met. Common Stock Share Repurchases We may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board of Directors, including pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings, once additional paid-in capital is depleted. 60\",\n",

The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 13 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.07 billion. Share-based Compensation Plans We maintain two share-based employee compensation plans: the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended in June 2016 (2012 Plan), and the 2005 Stock Plan (collectively, Stock Plans). Our 2012 Plan serves as the successor to our 2005 Stock Plan and provides for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Outstanding awards under the 2005 Stock Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005 Stock Plan. We initially reserved 25 million shares of our Class A common stock for issuance under our 2012 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2012 Plan increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of the 2012 Plan, which will continue through and including April 2026 unless terminated earlier by our board of directors or a committee thereof, by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, our board of directors elected not to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance in 2017 and 2016, and approved an increase of 42 million shares reserved for issuance effective as of January 1, 2018. In addition, shares available for grant under the 2005 Stock Plan, which were reserved but not issued, forfeited or repurchased at their original issue price, or subject to outstanding awards under the 2005 Stock Plan as of the effective date of our IPO, were added to the reserves of the 2012 Plan and shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs are also added to the reserves of the 2012 Plan.

       " 'Table of Contents Sleep',\n",
       " 'Sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states: rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep and non-rapid eye movement, or non-REM, sleep. REM sleep, which is about 20-25% of total sleep experienced by adults, is characterized by a high level of brain activity, bursts of rapid eye movement, increased heart and respiration rates, and paralysis of many muscles. Non-REM sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth; stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest.',\n",
       " 'The upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles. Normally, during REM sleep and deeper levels of non-REM sleep, upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows. Individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep, called apneas, and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas. These breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration, causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond. Typically, the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep, causing the throat muscles to contract, opening the airway. After a few gasping breaths, blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself. Sufferers of OSA typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour. While these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep, the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions. In addition, OSA has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant co-morbidity for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.',\n",
       " 'A long-term epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26% of adults age 30-70 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea. In the United States alone, this represents approximately 46 million people. Despite the high prevalence of OSA, there is a general lack of awareness of OSA among both the medical community and the general public. It is estimated that less than 20% of those with OSA have been diagnosed or treated. Many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose OSA because they are unaware that such non-specific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, hypertension and irritability are characteristic of OSA.',\n",
       " 'While OSA has been diagnosed in a broad cross-section of the population, until recently, it has typically been diagnosed among middle-aged men who are obese. However, we believe the importance of OSA in women is increasingly being recognized, with nearly 40% of new PAP patients being female. A strong association has been discovered between OSA and a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Studies have shown that SDB is present in approximately 83% of patients with drug-resistant hypertension, approximately 72% of patients with type 2 diabetes, approximately 77% of patients with obesity and approximately 76% of patients with chronic heart failure.',\n",
       " 'Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea',\n",
       " 'Sleep-disordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep. Manifestations include OSA, central sleep apnea, or CSA, and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep. Hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity, chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease. OSA is the most common form of SDB.',\n",
       " '- 3 -',\n",
       " 'Table of Contents Sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by OSA can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced cognitive function, including memory loss and lack of concentration, depression and irritability. OSA sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas. Several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation, increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by OSA may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina, stroke and heart attack. Patients with OSA have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving, response speed and visual motor coordination, and studies have linked OSA to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents.',\n",
       " \"Generally, an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of OSA is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation. The diagnosis of OSA typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient's home. During overnight testing, respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored, along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Simpler tests, using devices such as our Apnealink Air, or our automatic positive airway pressure devices, monitor airflow during sleep, and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns. These tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas, hypopneas or subconscious awakenings.\",\n",
       " \"Before 1981, the primary treatment for OSA was a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient's windpipe. Alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate. UPPP alone has a poor success rate; however, when performed in conjunction with multi-stage upper airway surgical procedures, a greater success rate has been claimed. These combined procedures, performed by highly specialized surgeons, are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods. Surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for OSA. Other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery, mandibular advancement surgery, dental appliances, palatal implants, somnoplasty, nasal devices and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles. Alternative pharmaceutical therapy treatments are reported to be under development.\",\n",
       " 'A variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of OSA. Most are only partially effective, but CPAP is a reliable treatment for all severities of OSA and is considered first-line therapy. Use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a second-line option in patients unable to use CPAP or those with mild OSA. These devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway. CPAP is a non-invasive means of treating OSA. CPAP was first used as a treatment for OSA in 1980 by Dr. Colin Sullivan, the past Chairman of our Medical Advisory Board and was commercialized for treatment of OSA in the United States in the mid-1980s. During CPAP treatment, a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable air device that delivers room air at a positive pressure. The patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface. Continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed. Interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows. Sometimes, when a patient leaks air through their mouth, a full-face mask may need to be used, rather than a nasal interface.',\n",
       " '- 4 -',\n",
       " 'Table of Contents CPAP is not a cure and, therefore, must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required. Patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of CPAP treatment. Early generations of CPAP units provided limited patient comfort and convenience. Patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the CPAP device operating at the prescribed pressure. In more recent years, product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed. These include more comfortable patient interface systems; delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily; bilevel air devices, including Variable Positive Airway Pressure, or VPAP systems, which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation; heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable; and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night.',\n",

We aim to improve their quality of life and slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management.',\n",
       " 'Our products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP or VPAP systems at night, through to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support and those who require long-term oxygen therapy. Our devices are predominantly used in the home, and to a lesser extent in general hospital wards and respiratory wards. We supply CPAP and VPAP systems, non-invasive and invasive ventilators, humidifiers and accessories, including masks and tubing. We also offer stationary and portable battery powered oxygen concentrators for the administration of long-term oxygen therapy in the home as well as data management systems designed to improve the management of patients.',\n",
       " 'Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. COPD encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation, prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs. It is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways to noxious gases or particles. Symptoms encountered with COPD include shortness of breath on exertion as well as chronic cough and sputum production. COPD includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. A recent study based on recent epidemiology data estimates that there are approximately 380 million people worldwide who suffer from COPD.',\n",
       " 'Patients with COPD can have different clinical presentations. Patients with chronic bronchitis present with hypoxemia and hypercapnia, a chronic productive cough, cor pulmonale and are commonly overweight. Patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases, are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity. During sleep, chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia. In general, the more hypoxic a COPD patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep. Hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in COPD patients and is more pronounced in REM sleep. Some COPD patients may also suffer from co-morbid OSA, a condition known as Overlap Syndrome.',\n",

       " 'Table of Contents Overlap Syndrome. In patients with Overlap Syndrome, CPAP has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality, decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange. Non-invasive ventilation, or NIV, has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing. It may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays, as well as reducing and complication rates of factors such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. In patients with stable COPD the advantages of home NIV are less clear but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnea scores and health-related quality of life measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays.',\n",
       " 'Long-term oxygen therapy, or LTOT, is indicated in chronic respiratory failure patients. The administration of LTOT has been shown to increase survival rates in patients with severe resting hypoxemia. In hypoxemic COPD patients, LTOT is associated with a lower mortality compared to nocturnal oxygen therapy alone and improved health-related quality of life measures. In long-term COPD survivors with a history of congestive heart failure, LTOT is associated with a slowing of respiratory failure progression.',\n",
       " 'Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. OHS is characterized by the combination of obesity, chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and SDB after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation. OHS is frequently associated with OSA with an estimated 90% of patients also having OSA.',\n",
       " 'In patients with OHS, positive airway therapy, both CPAP and NIV, has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive.',\n",
       " 'Neuromuscular Disease. Neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly (via intrinsic muscle pathology) or indirectly (via nerve pathology) impair the functioning of muscles. Symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue, dysphagia, dyspnoea on exertion and at rest, sleepiness, morning headache, difficulties with concentration and mood changes. Most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation, being wheelchair-bound, swallowing difficulties, respiratory muscle weakness and, eventually, death from respiratory failure. Neuromuscular disorders can be progress rapidly or slowly. Rapidly progressive conditions, such as ALS and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers, are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years. Variable or slowly progressive conditions, such as Myotonic muscular dystrophy, are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy.',\n",
       " 'NIV treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases. In ALS patients, NIV treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures, sleep-related symptoms and survival.

We plan to continue to invest and expand our capabilities in this area.',\n",
       " 'The second horizon includes the use of connected devices for the treatment of respiratory failure both in the hospital and the home. We believe that COPD is a large and underpenetrated market where there are unmet patient needs as the global population with COPD continues to expand due to smoking and poor air quality. Some patients with later-stage COPD may benefit from the use of ventilation at night, but until recently only a small number of COPD patients were treated using ventilation on a long-term basis. A study published in 2014 found that patients with stable but severe COPD using non-invasive ventilation nightly for six months experienced a reduction in mortality and an improvement in quality of life and exercise capacity. The findings from this study and our associated marketing activities may result in an increase in the size of the homecare market for NIV. Additionally, the use of NIV is becoming routine in many acute care hospitals, as guidelines stipulate its use in acute exacerbations and familiarity with the techniques involved increases. In 2016, we expanded our product portfolio for the treatment of COPD with our acquisition of Inova Labs, a company that designs and manufactures POCs. Many patients in earlier stages of COPD may require oxygen therapy and through the use of NIV and POC products they can receive this treatment in the home.',\n",

A growing body of literature documents the association and interactions between a number of cardiac diseases and SDB. OSA is the most common secondary cause of hypertension and is prevalent in hypertensive populations, particularly those resistant to therapy. Treatment with CPAP tends to lower blood pressure. OSA is prevalent in those with atrial fibrillation and may trigger episodes of fibrillation. Treatment with CPAP appears to improve outcomes. OSA is also known to be a strong risk factor for the development of acute coronary disease and cardiovascular disease in general. Heart failure is also commonly associated with both OSA and CSA, and both forms of SDB are risk factors for poor outcomes. We are undertaking several clinical trials in cardiology to strengthen the knowledge base on the effects of SDB therapy on outcomes. In addition to clinical trials we pursue suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the importance of SDB in cardiology patients.',\n",

Domestic third-party payors include government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid and commercial health insurance plans. These payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. The long-term trend towards cost-containment, through managed healthcare, or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare, could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products. In some foreign markets, such as France, Germany and Japan, government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products, subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In Australia, China, and in some other foreign markets, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat OSA.',\n",

The longer term impact, though not entirely predictable, continues to bring significant changes to the third-party payor landscape.',\n",
       " 'Beginning in 2005, the MMA established a Medicare competitive acquisition program for home medical equipment, or HME, and imposed quality standards and accreditation requirements for HME suppliers. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, implemented the competitive bidding program beginning in 2011, and included HME that we manufacture and develop, specifically, oxygen CPAP and respiratory assist devices, and related supplies and accessories. CMS is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years. In addition, the ACA required CMS to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in non-competitive bidding areas, also known as the non-bid or Round 3 areas, to match competitive bidding prices by 2016. CMS phased in the new rates beginning January 1, 2016, and the rates became fully effective July 1, 2016. As a result of the national rollout, Medicare payment for CPAP devices in non-competitive bidding areas was reduced by approximately 60% in urban areas and approximately 56% in rural areas, as compared to the Medicare payment rates that were effective in 2015. The implementation of the competitive acquisition program has resulted in reduced Medicare payment for oxygen CPAP and respiratory assist devices, and related supplies and accessories in both competitive bidding areas and non-competitive bidding areas.',\n",
       " 'On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law, which retroactively adjusted rates in non-bid areas to allow for higher phase-in rates to be paid for items furnished between July 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016, rather than the lower fully-adjusted rates.

In addition, the FDA is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution.',\n",

The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device's safety and effectiveness.\",\n",

The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is \"substantially equivalent\" to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be \"substantially equivalent\" to such a pre-1976 device, a predecessor device is referred to as \"predicate device.\" As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information.',\n",

After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device's safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. The FDA recently reviewed its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510(k) for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device and determined that manufacturers should continue adhering to the 1997 guidance on this topic. In August 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance that it believes preserves the basic content and format of the 1997 guidance, with updates to add clarity.\",\n",

Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE Mark, manufacturers of medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification.

Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would audit and examine the Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements.

Unless a product is exempt, before we can market or sell a new medical device in the United States, we must obtain FDA clearance or approval, which can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. We generally receive clearance from the FDA to market our products in the United States under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or our products are exempt from the Section 510(k) clearance process. The 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \"substantially equivalent\" to a device legally on the market, known as a \"predicate\" device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. The FDA has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510(k) clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. After a device receives 510(k) premarket notification clearance from the FDA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, technology, materials, packaging, and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. We have modified some of our Section 510(k) approved products without submitting new Section 510(k) notices, which we do not believe were required. However, if the FDA disagrees with us and requires us to submit new Section 510(k) notifications for modifications to our existing products, we may be required to stop marketing the products while the FDA reviews the Section 510(k) notification.',\n",

For example, in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510(k) notice. We may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products. Indeed, recent trends in the FDA's review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the FDA is often requiring manufacturers to provide new, more expansive, or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510(k) submission. This has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process.\",\n",
       " \"For example, the FDA recently evaluated its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510(k) for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device. Although the FDA had proposed a number of changes to a long-standing guidance from 1997 on this topic, the FDA concluded that manufacturers should continue adhering to the principles in the 1997 guidance. In August 2016, the FDA issued a new draft guidance, which FDA believes preserves the basic format and content of the 1997 guidance with updates to add clarity. The FDA's ongoing review of the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product, or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. FDA continues to review its 510(k) clearance process which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents which could increase the costs of compliance, or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances. The requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process and/or significant changes to the 510(k) clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with FDA compliance.

The preliminary headline results showed no significant difference with respect to all-cause mortality and hospitalization. However, the analysis of the data identified a statistically significant, 2.5% absolute, increased risk of cardiovascular mortality for those patients in the trial who received ASV therapy with moderate to severe predominant central sleep apnea and symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. We worked with global regulatory authorities to revise the labels and instructions for use for ResMed ASV devices as well as informing healthcare providers, physicians, and patients of the cardiovascular safety signal observed in SERVE-HF.

We intend to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested in our international operations. We reassess our reinvestment intentions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to support our assertion that the undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently. If these earnings had not been permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of approximately $358 million would have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.',\n",
       " \"We repatriated $215 million and $190 million to the U.S. in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. The amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the U.S. in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2018 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the U.S., such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations. The majority of our repatriation of foreign subsidiaries' earnings to the U.S. has historically occurred at year-end, although we may repatriate funds earlier in the year based on our business needs, as we did during the year ended June 30, 2017. When we repatriate funds to the U.S., we are required to pay taxes in the U.S. on these amounts based on applicable U.S. tax rates, net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against U.S. income tax. We paid $24.6 million and $34.2 million in additional U.S. federal income taxes in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in those years.\",\n",

This was lower than the cash generated from operations for the year ended June 30, 2016 of $547.9 million, which was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable and corporate income tax payments. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended June 30, 2017 had the effect of increasing our cash and cash equivalents by $21.2 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. During fiscal year 2016, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to acquisitions. Accordingly, we did not purchase any shares during fiscal year 2017. During fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $102.1 million.
